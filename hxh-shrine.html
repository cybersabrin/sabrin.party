<h1 style="color: blueviolet;">illumi zoldyck</h1>
<p style="text-align: center;">also spelled yellmi Zaoldyck</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2F66.media.tumblr.com%2Fb13964ff02c1a6037a9a9006862f6682%2Ftumblr_os8u3b5GBt1qg7pvuo1_500.gifv&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=b0b73bf5be9ac0b5208d565885bc24505da3b556ed91758c6156544ecafdab4b&ipo=images>"></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify;">yellmi is my favorite character ever. while i actually did not pay attention to him during my first watch (there have been many... many watches since then) (i think the count is at around 7 watches? i don't actually remember) but the second time i watched this show i was immediately charmed by illumi's strange and off-putting personality. <img style="float: left; padding: 10px;" src="/images/gittarackur1.gif" height="220"> first thing i'd like to note is his alter-ego, Gittarackur. any guy who decides to present himself to the world looking like THIS <img src="https://graphic.neocities.org/tumblr_ltj3qtwg3Y1r17znu.gif"> is bound to recieve my eternal love. this look is actually <a style="color:blue" href="https://cdn.readdetectiveconan.com/file/mangap/1828/10026000/16.jpeg?t=1664952909"> pretty painful to achieve</a>, which goes to show how far our guy is willing to go for the bit. also? so incredibly gender. i'll do a section on that later.</p>
<br>
<p>a lot of people don't like illumi for many reasons. all of these reasons are wrong therefore i will not acknowledge them. the way togashi wrote his character is absolutely brilliant, one of my favorite things about him is how chatty and talkative he is in his cheerful and light voice which contrasts so starkly against his huge alien-esque soulless eyes and stoic expression it's such a fascinating combo. he is so special. <img style="float: right; padding: 10px;" src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi.pinimg.com%2Foriginals%2F71%2Fdb%2Fb2%2F71dbb2142088e1978f723d5f36a6ad85.gif&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=c12d00a742e228089de817777efe142a4cacb7ce2c85f48b4271c6bba6b62b29&ipo=images" height="160">while growing up on a huge manor in kukuro mountain, illumi is a creature through and through. social skills, materialism, and all that jazz mean nothing to him. Why Mattress When Dirt Soft Too? he's a simple guy with one thing on his mind: his family. i think illumi is very unhealthy about his family and how he loves and protects them and for this i think he is really fun.</p>
<p>the main way this is shown is through the way he talks to his younger brother <span style="background-color: aqua;">killua <img src="https://graphic.neocities.org/003.GIF"> </span>and hier to the zoldyck throne(?).</p>
    
    <p style="text-align: justify;">being the Eldest, <span hover style="background-color: hotpink;">yellmi raised killua with his bare hands</span><img style="float: left; padding: 10px;" src="/images/illumi-raised-killu1.png" height="200"> for the sake of his family. illumi's main goal is to make sure killua suceeds in fulfilling his role in the family, not taking the time to consider anything else killua might want because in illumi's pov, nothing matters more than family. i'm sure this sentiment is something a lot of us with Familly Issues grapple with often. he's overbearing and controlling and is genuinely shocked to find out killua might like someone else (gon) more than his own brother?? <iframe width="300" height="170" style="float: right; padding: 10px;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_0GGLILyOM4" title=""Huh? Huh? Oh! Am I wrong"Hisoka and Illumi bar scene" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">i think a major reason why illumi is so hung up on this idea that he cant have friends (does he really know what friendship truly is? i dont think so considering his actual friendship with hisoka he doesn't seem to recognize as such) is because of his main priority towards his family. perhaps its because he was denied the Hier title despite being the oldest child so he serves his family to make up for it? but i also think this may not be true since the zoldycks subvert so many other Standards and Norms who's to say they don't always deem the eldest the Heir.</p>
    <p>
        anyways, another point i want to make before i move on is the whole nen needle manipulation he put in killua that made him run away whenever he faced an overwhelming opponent. <img style="float: left; padding: 10px;" src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia1.tenor.com%2Fimages%2F75a44bcbc86442c983c77b18e5344265%2Ftenor.gif%3Fitemid%3D5298875&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=0eee0121303a9e03ce891250da9f10dd6388a4733e8c15d1daab29b13822cfaf&ipo=images" height="160">while obviously understanding the fact that this needle has tortured baby killu for years and totally messed up his ideas about his own self worth and purpose in life, i also wanted to explore this dynamic as a way of yellmi allowing his brother some freedom (sort of in the same way silva "allows" him to adventure knowing well he will be manipulated back into the Family Business) while still <span style="background-color: yellowgreen;">protecting him from harm when illumi is not nearby to save him</span> which is truly messed up but also... so in line with illumi's thinking? i mean in his perspective he actually came up with a genius automated babysitter. the needle scared killua enough to flee from anyone stronger than he is, both sharpening his assassin skillz or whatever but also pretty mych guarenteeing his safety??? illumi you are so big brained for this. life360 but better (but actually worse). i remember bringing this up to a friend for the first time because i didn't realize no one else read that situation this way and she validated my illumi thinking.
    </p>
    <p>despite his poor emotinal responses, warped decision making skills, and codependency issues i do want to emphasize yellmi's fun <iframe width="400" height="300" style="float: right; padding: 10px;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k4fxnAtCt18" title="Illumi's Dance || Hunter x Hunter: The Nightmare of Zoldyck" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>silly and goofy traits because they are Important. would you want someone judging your entire character based on how you act during your times of distress? i didn't think so! my all-time favorite illumi is from the hxh musical. an incredbily silly and unserious lad. the most memorable example is this iconic dancing scene because he totally did Not need to do that. but he did. he decided of his own free will to do a little dancy dance before freeing his family from hisoka's strings!!!!!! a free spirit indeed. </p>
