        <p style="text-align: center;">i simply do not know how to be normal about this show in real life nor do i know how to be normal about this on the internet. welcome to my favorite tv show of all time. let's BEGIN.</p>

        <br>
        <h1 style="color:darkgreen; text-align: left;">story</h1>
        <p style="color: teal;-webkit-text-stroke: 1px;">the general plot of the show follows this cute little lad on the left, gon freeccs, <img src="https://graphic.neocities.org/001.GIF">, who's goal is to find his father (a really...... fascinating fella. more on him later) and become a Hunter!!!! his dad left him as a child to go adventure and stuff and gon follows in his footsteps. on the way he meets new friends!!! NEXT: Characters.</p>

<h1 style="color: blueviolet;">illumi zoldyck</h1>
<p style="text-align: center;">also spelled yellmi Zaoldyck</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2F66.media.tumblr.com%2Fb13964ff02c1a6037a9a9006862f6682%2Ftumblr_os8u3b5GBt1qg7pvuo1_500.gifv&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=b0b73bf5be9ac0b5208d565885bc24505da3b556ed91758c6156544ecafdab4b&ipo=images>"></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify;">yellmi is my favorite character ever. while i actually did not pay attention to him during my first watch (there have been many... many watches since then) (i think the count is at around 7 watches? i don't actually remember) but the second time i watched this show i was immediately charmed by illumi's strange and off-putting personality. <img style="float: left; padding: 10px;" src="/images/gittarackur1.gif" height="220"> first thing i'd like to note is his alter-ego, Gittarackur. any guy who decides to present himself to the world looking like THIS <img src="https://graphic.neocities.org/tumblr_ltj3qtwg3Y1r17znu.gif"> is bound to recieve my eternal love. this look is actually <a style="color:blue" href="https://cdn.readdetectiveconan.com/file/mangap/1828/10026000/16.jpeg?t=1664952909"> pretty painful to achieve</a>, which goes to show how far our guy is willing to go for the bit. also? so incredibly gender. i'll do a section on that later.</p>
<br>
<p>a lot of people don't like illumi for many reasons. all of these reasons are wrong therefore i will not acknowledge them. the way togashi wrote his character is absolutely brilliant, one of my favorite things about him is how chatty and talkative he is in his cheerful and light voice which contrasts so starkly against his huge alien-esque soulless eyes and stoic expression it's such a fascinating combo. he is so special. <img style="float: right; padding: 10px;" src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi.pinimg.com%2Foriginals%2F71%2Fdb%2Fb2%2F71dbb2142088e1978f723d5f36a6ad85.gif&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=c12d00a742e228089de817777efe142a4cacb7ce2c85f48b4271c6bba6b62b29&ipo=images" height="160">while growing up on a huge manor in kukuro mountain, illumi is a creature through and through. social skills, materialism, and all that jazz mean nothing to him. Why Mattress When Dirt Soft Too? he's a simple guy with one thing on his mind: his family. i think illumi is very unhealthy about his family and how he loves and protects them and for this i think he is really fun. the main way this is shown is through the way he talks to his younger brother <span style="background-color: aqua;">killua <img src="https://graphic.neocities.org/003.GIF"> </span>and hier to the zoldyck throne(?). </p>
