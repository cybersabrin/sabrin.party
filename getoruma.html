    <h1>getoruma bible</h1>
    <p>okay so hear me out. I can’t write (creatively) for shit so im just going to. talk about them. for a bit here. getoruma have been rotting my brain for a few days here is why they are important to me:</p>
    <p>higuruma and geto actually have soo much in common especially in terms of their ideological arc (if that’s the right way to put it?) from beginning to end<a href="#Reference1"><sup>1</sup></a>. they mirror. parallels.</p>
    <h3>1. sense of Justice & their turning points</h3>
    <p>they both start off with a very Strong sense of Justice and a clear and moral understanding of their role in society as people with this kind of power in their hands. higuruma used his power to dedicate his life to protecting people through the law. his way of "protecting the weak" was by taking on impossible cases and fighting against the systematically unjust legal system with a conviction rate of 99.9%. what a burden that man carries on his tired shoulders. that case he took up in defense of the falsely accused oe keita (ch. 159) and eventual <strong>failure</strong> of this case was the trigger for higuruma. before i get too far into that i need to talk about how this bascially pretty much directly mirror's geto's beginnings. in high school we see that geto believed his role as a jujutsu sorcerer is to "protect the weak and keep the strong in check" (ch. 65). they both just want to help people because they have the power to do so. just like higuruma, geto is assigned a task from master tengen to escort (protect) riko and deliver her to tengen in order to protect humanity. he's really connected to this mission, and also shows us how important found family is to him (ch. 67). so it's really sad to see how despite how emotionally invested he was in this mission and how hard he tried to save her, he too <strong>failed</strong> her. with rika's death, his outlook- his reality- on shamans and non-shamans is completely shattered. her death & the regret he has over deciding to protect that non-shaman tengen worshipping cult is the trigger for his shift in ideology. </p>

    <sup id="fn1">1. obviously, higurama diverges away from his doomer attitude and "went back to his roots" at the end of his fight/court proceeding with yuji, which is very important but i'll talk about that later.<a href="#ref1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩</a></sup>
