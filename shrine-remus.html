            She likes to climb onto high places (to establish dominance and superiority) and plays with her toys <img style="float: right; margin: 10px;" src="https://graphic.neocities.org/tumblr_me9z6qxy341rpa4ggo3_100.gif">
            by pawing on them AND she also bathes herself <em>she's so hygenic!!! world's first muslim dog!!!!</em> (wow remus you really are como un gato!!!!) although i have
            never met remus in real life (YET...... as of january 2023 to be exact) (i will meet her one day) (and flo too) i love
            remus a lot. she is clearly the cutest pup you have ever seen and the fact that she doesn't know how
            to act like a dog makes her the best dog in the world. an icon, truly. ( ´ ▽ ` ).｡ｏ♡ <strong>but hold on!!! let's take a deeper
                look into our favorite pup. what is she up to when flo is not home????</strong> this is a great question. flo told me. stay tuned for this next

           <p style="color: black;">what does remus get up to when she's <img style="float: right; padding: 10px; width: 200px;" src="/images/remus-shrine/remus3.png">home alone? well for one, shes a WEAPON OF MASS DESTRUCTION!!!!!!! according to flo, remus reaches peak mischief levels when she's home alone as an act of REVENGE against flo for leaving her in the first place (okay but like isn't that the cuest thing you've ever heard....</p>
            <p style="color: black;">here is a list of items (and evidence) of things remus has destroyed when left to her own devices:</p>
<ul>
    <li style="margin: 0px 40px; color: black;"><strong>bokuto-shaped mini cardboard figure (REST IN PEACE BOKUTO)</strong></li>
    <li style="margin: 0px 80px; list-style: circle; color: black;">this was a personal attack (according to sources) with the evidence in question being
    that he was DECAPITATED!!!!!!! wow remus...... you sure seem to have an ~inner darkness~ within you...</li> 
    <li style="margin: 0px 40px; color: black;">(ooh i was there for this one i got the live texts #truestory) <strong>she ripped apart flo's oikawa plushie</strong></li>
    <li style="margin: 0px 80px; list-style: circle; color: black;">in memorium please take a look at the BEFORE images of remus and oikawa pretending to be friends...... before the DISASTER

    <p style="font-size: 42pt; background-color: paleturquoise; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: black;">REMUS GETS SUGAR HIGH?!</p>
    <br>
    <p style="color: black;">you heard me. <strong>christmas eve.</strong> remus is acting stranger than usual... up and about acting super hyper at 1:00 AM!!! she usually goes to 
    bed pretty early (around 10pm) so this is very strange behavior indeed. what on earth could have been the cause of this?????
 let me tell you. Flo & famiiy realized that she had EATEN HER MOM'S PIECE OF CAKE AND WAS 
CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING A SUGAR RUSH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! some may call her silly for this,
others may feel concerned. i however, see this as a FEAT. our dearest Remus here is a <span style="background-color: palevioletred;">#FIRSTGEN</span> sugar rush achiever.</p>
<p style="color: black;">remus is and will always be a winner. (＠＾◡＾)</p>
