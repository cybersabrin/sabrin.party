            <p>this is my own personal website i made on my very own thanks to help from people on the internet like sadgrl.online and youtube. the goal? dream of this is to use this site as like.. a little home. blogging and such. so that one day i may eventually be free from the chokehold social media has me in... i think it will work. this is fun......</p>

            <p>here is where u will find my blog posts that will probably be categorized somehow once i figure that out...</p>
            <br>
            <article id="first-post">

                <br>
                <p>i think i'm starting to get a hang of this website building thing? thank you to the internet for being my teacher... it is so late, my head hurts a little and i'm still not tired. i am to blame. once i figure out this whole coding thing and learn how to make stuff fully on my own i will probably have more puter-related things to say. but for my first post? entry... i will pratice my list making skills.</p>
                <br>
                <p>that was a lie i won't be doing that yet. first i want to tell you about my day. i went to a <strong>bookstore!!!!!</strong> with my friend and even though i said i would only buy myself two books i could not control my impulses so i bought four. here is a list of the books i bought today:</p>
