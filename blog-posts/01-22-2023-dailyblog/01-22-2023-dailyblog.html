            hello! i'm having a lot of fun learning how to animate images. although it's really really hard. it took me two whole days to figure out how to make puss in boots spin on hover. anywho. its the last day of ~freedom~ before my semester starts tomorrow, and i am really nervous about my upcoming calculus and computer science classes.

            i am not really a math person, and i added this computer science degree to my courseload because i wanted a challenge (and i don't want to be poor!)  ..・ヾ(。＞＜)シ  but i know i can do well! i know once i start classes tomorrow i will feel better.

            this post is doubling as a movie review for <strong>puss in  boots: the last wish</strong>. i saw this yesterday with my friend and we LOVED it. this was so surprisingly good i am comfortable calling it the most Movie ever.

            i've never seen the previous movies so i didn't really know what to expect. the first / intro song <a style="background-color: hotpink; color: yellow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8EAdlxwsq8">"fearless hero"</a> is such a bop it's been stuck in head since i watched it. i loved everything about that movie it's hard to figure out where to start. <Img src="/blog-posts/01-22-2023-dailyblog/pussinboots2.gif" height="100" style="float: right; padding: 10px;"> i loved the villain of the movie, the Reaper wolf guy. and i love how he wasn't really a bad guy, just absolutely terrifying (nearly pissed myself whenever he showed up) (fun fact: my friend told me during the movie that in some culture people bury loved ones with coins atop their eyes and that sort of symbolizes death, hence the coins in wolfie's eyes here. i thought that was really cool). i've never seen a movie like this explore the fear of death, how to deal with these fears and still make sure to stop and smell the roses.

            i am officially a puss in boots Fan after watching this movie. <img src="/blog-posts/01-22-2023-dailyblog/pussinboots1.gif" height="100" style="float: left; padding: 10px;"> kitty and puss are so much fun. i really enjoyed their dynamics and their adorable ending together. i'm not much of a romantic but who wouldn't awe at "one life spent with you is all that i could wish for" like come on now. (≧◡≦) ♡

            i guess my one critique of the movie was that it would have been better if there were more songs. but that doesn't really carry much weight overall. i think with that intro song i was expecting more songs like a <img src="/blog-posts/01-22-2023-dailyblog/pussinboots3.gif" height="100" style="float: right; padding: 10px;"> disney money. and it would have been so good. but despite all that i'd give this movie a 10/10. the animation was incredible, i love how choppy it looked (choppy isn't the right word, but whatever they did gave it a comic-book esque feel and i really loved it)

            after seeing that masterpiece of a film, me and my friend went to a vegan thai food place nearby. i had fried dumplings, <img src="/blog-posts/01-22-2023-dailyblog/tom-yom-gai-soup.JPG" height="150" style="float: left; padding: 10px"> wontons (yum), and some tom yum gai soup. every time i try something new here to see what i like. i did not enjoy the soup as much but i think that's just because i don't like water based soup in general. i luv creamy soups. next time i'm in town i think i will try one of their noodle soups. they come in huge bowls, so i will definetly be taking home leftovers. (^人^)
