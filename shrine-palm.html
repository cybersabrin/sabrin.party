            that tweet saying <a href="https://twitter.com/cozybao/status/1629452334173667328" target="_blank">'to be loved is to be changed'</a> reminded me of palm and how she's changed throughout the series. her character arc is one of my favorites. people put too much emphasis on how much of a Freak she is but i think theres more to her than her obvious trauma. she is introduced as a complete Wreck who is obsessed with Knov, her captor, wanting him to come back to her as he is the only one who gives her any sort of specialized attention. she is clearly being abused <a href="/images/hxh-shrine/characters/knovpalm.png" target="_blank">(seriously what is he doing with her blood)</a>.

                     and is acting insane because of it. before meeting killugon, she was harmful to herself and others. and then she meets gon! and they hang out on their "date" and he is so kind to her (and probably the only person in her life who has ever shown her kindness, and i don't think that's an exaggeration). and then she meets gon! and they hang out on their "date" and is so kind to her

                     (and probably the only person in her life who has ever shown her kindness, and i don't think that's an exaggeration). and that's just the purest expression of love (in a platonic way of course, don't be weird) and this obviously changes her dramatically (as love often does). i think that 'date with palm' chapter and episode is really important for showing palm what love means and what it looks like for her. which ultimately leads to her coming to a point where she knows enough to show her love by stepping back and actually letting killua be there for gon because she now knows it's what he needs. it gives her a new perspective. without gon's kindness she would not have changed the way she did. hence, <strong>to be loved is to be changed.</strong></p>
