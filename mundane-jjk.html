<ul>
    <li>often caught mumbling things like “who the hell wrote this garbage that is NOT how it happened” while making passive aggressive footnotes for his next publication</li>
    <li>lied about his birthday on his job application</li>
    <li>good eye for catching the counter-narratives of important historical events (mostly heian era centric)</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle; margin-top: 2px;">i'm being intentionally vague about how much of canon jjk lore lives on in this au. it's funny that he says things like this as if he lived in that era but did he? who knows.</li>
    <li>works with museums if he gets his hands on something particularly interesting. likes talking about his work but also hates being asked stupid questions about his work</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle; margin-top: 2px;">will ask for speaker opportunities that are more exclusive because he is a bitch</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle; margin-top: 2px;">declines any and all collaborative projects with other scholars. he is not built for that</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle; margin-top: 2px;">while a lot of the work he does can be considered cultural preservation, his work is (hush hush) used by militaries to develop war strategies or something</li>
    <li><span><u>current project of interest:</u> he is looking at heian era court records about martial arts training that was most common in the higher ranks of that social hierarchy. analyzes lots of the literature from that era with major themes of wars, military, warrior culture</span></li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle; margin-top: 2px;">tries to take inspiration from what he gatherers from these texts and applies them to his boxing sessions. flexing those creative muscles. it's kind of working?</li>
    <li>i like the idea of him having poor eyesight and wearing glasses (insert four-eyes joke here) but i'm not that attached to this concept. it would just be funny to me</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle; margin-top: 2px;">another possibility: eyepatch wearer, old eye injury rendered him blind in that eye, when he's dealing with a particularly hard to read text he whips out his pocket magnifying glass (which is always getting lost...)</li>

    <li>is a member of his neighborhood boxing gym</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle; margin-top: 2px;">loves to spar, his gym bros are really kind, none match up his skill level though</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle; margin-top: 2px;">toji is his favorite sparring partner (toji is shameless and this amuses him)</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle; margin-top: 2px;">go on runs together when the weather gets nice… among other summertime activities. they go on a mountain hike at one point.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle; margin-top: 2px;">they have a cute moment on their hike where it's early morning in their tent (shared tent...) and sukuna wakes up before him. he doesn't move because he realized he likes watching toji sleep</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle; margin-top: 2px;">religiously attends the gym every weekend, boxing is the perfect outlet to release his energy. also (surprisingly) really helps with his back pain.</li>
    <li>early riser</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle; margin-top: 2px;">has a hard time falling asleep in unfamiliar places. if he is not sleeping in his own bed he sleeps very lightly and will wake up at the slightest sounds</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle; margin-top: 2px;">the sun makes the scars on his face feel sensitive so if the sun is shining on his face in the morning it will wake him up</li>
    <li>ask me why he's planning to buy an engagement ring.</li>
    <li>(before tjkn marriage) he picked these rings out a few months after meeting toji and becoming... Friends or whatever you want to call it. the original reason was because yorozu just started working there and is so terribly irksome with her constant love letters and advances. not even uraume scares her off, which is impressive on its own</li>
    <li>really, he only needed one ring for the “i’m married” excuse, so why was he looking at sets? and why was he thinking of toji’s ring-shaped tan line as he was shopping?</li>
    <li>now that tjkn are married sukuna wears his ring all the time. except when he's boxing of course.</li>

    <br>
    <li style="padding-right: 5px;">sukuna is his favorite sparring partner, he likes figuring out how to adapt to his weird fighting style. it's like, ancient.</li>
    <li>one weekend sukuna doesn't come to the gym... (<u>tojikuna interlude</u> begin!)</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle; margin-top: 2px;">toji shows up at sukuna's place of work to get a hold of his number or something, unfortunately the first person he runs into is kenjaku (who is not in his own department... where he is supposed to be)</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle; margin-top: 2px;">once toji asks kenjaku about sukuna he immediately starts spewing lie after lie to send him off on a wild goose chase</li>

    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle; margin-top: 2px;"><strong>toji:</strong> [schlurp, audible swallow] “emergency services how can i—”</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: none; margin-top: 2px;"><strong>caller:</strong> someone is in my house I think I'm getting robbed help my address is [...]</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: none; margin-top: 2px;"><strong>toji:</strong> uh, i've seen those housing prices, miss, no one is robbing you. just turn on the light i bet it's your roommate again [hits end call button on headset]</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 40px; list-style-type: circle; margin-top: 2px;">more lore on this: this caller ended up being the lady who own the boxing gym he attends. she figured this out and now hates him for it</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 40px; list-style-type: circle; margin-top: 2px;">eventually starts sending sukuna to beg for her to open later because she won't say yes to him if he's there</li>
    <li>snarky and mean to non-emergency callers but not rude enough to get fired over it</li>
    <li>can't cook</li>
    <li>dead wife</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle; margin-top: 2px;">moved away from the town he and mamaguro lived in, hated by her family and it was truly miserable having to look at their ugly mugs every day so he skipped town to just be able to breathe for a moment. boxing gym in his new neighborhood is his haven</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle; margin-top: 2px;">right after mamaguro died he sort of got into street fighting. but not too deep in it. "street fighting" as in bar fights almost every night.. in the street. (too far into street fighter toji wouldn't fit the realm of the mundane anymore so...)</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle; margin-top: 2px;">once he moved, he discovered boxing in a more controlled setting is way more fun. more room to breathe. sober enough to think. its a fun mental and physical exercise. still a dirty fighter but is growing out of it</li>
    <li>a married man (to sukuna...)</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle; margin-top: 2px;">wears his ring on his right hand (as yu says: <i>not overriding the past but still looking forwards the future</i>). when they hold hands the rings clink (thanks mizu)</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle; margin-top: 2px;">mostly wears his ring on a necklace, though</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle; margin-top: 2px;">has their wedding photos pinned up on the walls of his caller cubicle. and one photo of toji winning one round of boxing. his proudest moment.</li>

    <ul style="margin-top: -0px;">
        <li>originally applied to intern at the natural sciences division (where kenjaku works) to get her hands on some good entomology research opportunities</li>
        <li>the spot she was aiming for filled up, so she settled for the next opening they had... with sukuna!</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<ul style="margin-top: -6px;">
    <li>main job is to make sukuna miserable</li>
    <li>helps digitize most of the records in their collection because sukuna hates doing it</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle; margin-top: 2px;">other job responsibilities include: translating the heian era literature sukuna is in charge of to different languages (although she's actually quite bad at this, sukuna eventually took her off this job), dodge uraume during their surprise visits (their altercations are worse than uraume and kenjaku's), and other side projects</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle; margin-top: 2px;">is personally interested in developing educational materials, but it's not a priority for the department (it's really sad.. they won't let her have anything!)</li>
    <li>thinks the HR department loves her (why else would they call me into the office  all the time?) it is unknown how she still has a job here</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle; margin-top: 2px;"><strong>uraume:</strong> if i have to attend one more sexual harassment training because of her im going to forcibly send her to a papal cloister. i've been researching a few nearby. (uraume doesn't even work there. they don't have to attend the meetings)</li>
    <li>hides love letters in between ancient scrolls that sukuna has to analyze. thinks she's being cute. sukuna doesn't even read them</li>
    <li>has never come to work in accordance to the dress code in her life</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle; margin-top: 2px;">talking to her about it is like talking to a brick wall she simply cannot hear you. “sorry my tits are in the way, what did you say? i can't hear you”</li>
