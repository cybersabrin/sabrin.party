<h2>now what if...</h2>
<p>this is mostly centered around the heian era sorcerers of jujutsu kaisen, except they are not sorcerers. i've been spending too much brainpower thinking up all sorts of hilarious situations to put these guys in, which sort of spiraled into a fully fledged mundane alternate universe for them. kenjaku, sukuna, toji, and uraume are drawn by the lovely <a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/tojishole">tojishole</a> on twitter. yuki is drawn by the incredible <a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/naihilan_/status/1652500833223733249?s=20" target="_blank">naihilan_</a> and yorozu was drawn by the wonderful <a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/moddleoddIe?s=20" target="_blank">moddleoddIe</a> on twitter.</p>
<p>links on the birthdays lead to their respective birth charts, because i used to have an astrology phase so i came up with their own mundane canon birthdays that make sense for their personalities. other links lead to art on twitter or songs that correspond with whatever i'm talking about on here.</p>

<ul>
    <li>compulsive liar. self aware</li>
    <li>walks in like "did you hear those alarms? check out the ovarian cancer sample we worked on, it doesn't look normal" and the intern comes back like “you can't just lie about this it's not even funny!” and he's like “well maybe stop being believing me every time?”</li>
    <li>his lab assistants <i>really</i> dislike him</li>
    <li>was infertile, worked with the team who conducted her surgery to unblock her fallopian tubes (it was a small blockage). no longer infertile! unsure if he wants to have kids, though.</li>
    <li>spends too much time hanging out in the other departments</li>

    <li>cannot keep a single thought to himself Ever</li> 
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle;">it's a miracle she has not been terminated or sent to jail the way he talks about his research on human subjects? (this is because no one can tell if he is joking when she mentions the dead fetus remains in his refrigerator... he has to be joking?)</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle;">made one Former intern cry after calling her “the most brain damaged idiotic vegetable to ever waltz into this lab. you have got the intellectual capacity of a flatworm. seriously, who let you in here.”</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 30px; list-style-type: square;">forced to go through mandatory professional development and sensitivity training after this event. kenjaku is now often seen smiling and nodding at her interns and interrupting (at the wrong times) with phrases like “that is the smartest thing anyone has ever said in this lab”</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 30px; list-style-type: square;">this is somehow more hurtful...</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle;">also likes to just word vomit all of the details of their current projects and plans to anyone who will sit still long enough to listen. they have so many plans!!! making real moves in the field and noooo one listens...</li>

    <li>carries around a small bag of peanuts coated with cyanide in his lab coat pocket for when he wants to hang out at the park... and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhuMLpdnOjY" style="background-color: transparent; color:blue ;" target="_blank">feed some pigeons</a>...</li>
    <li>kenjaku (experiencing a particularly stressful week): im going to rip my brain out of my fucking skull and leave it outside for the birds and other small creatures</li>
    <li>makes up reasons to get their lab assistants out of their sight so uraume can take over (perks of this: good lunch)</li>
    <li>licks the dentist on purpose during visits</li>

    </div>
</div>

<ul>
    <li>often caught mumbling things like “who the hell wrote this garbage that is NOT how it happened” while making passive aggressive footnotes for his next publication</li>
    <li>lied about his birthday on his job application</li>
    <li>good eye for catching the counter-narratives of important historical events (mostly heian era centric)</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle; margin-top: 2px;">i'm being intentionally vague about how much of canon jjk lore lives on in this au. it's funny that he says things like this as if he lived in that era but did he? no.</li>
    <li>works with museums if he gets his hands on something particularly interesting. likes talking about his work but also hates being asked stupid questions about his work</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle; margin-top: 2px;">will ask for speaker opportunities that are more exclusive because he is a bitch</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle; margin-top: 2px;">declines any and all collaborative projects with other scholars. he is not built for that</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 10px; list-style-type: square; margin-top: 2px;">lesson learned after his workplace tried to hire a junior archivist and sukuna <strong>would not stop</strong> Loudly talking shit about them with uraume while they were in the room.. he felt so shitty he quit without giving a two weeks notice</li>
    <li>while a lot of the work he does can be considered cultural preservation, his work is (hush hush) used by militaries to develop war strategies or something</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle; margin-top: 2px;">(if anyone cares, this is a long ass paragraph describing their Place of Work) basically kenjaku sukuna yorozu all work at the same Place. they are a kinda sorta weird organization that branches out into different sectors: biology, medicine, history, etc. they are a private organization BUT they also are buddy-buddy with the government so they will share resources sometimes. most of the workers don't know what they're up to. i like the air of mystery. the organization is OLD old... Latest known records are from 1543 but it's possible they've been established before. kenjaku COULD know what they're up to but cares more about his work so he doesn't bother since it's not relevant to him. sukuna also cares too much about his work and doesn't bother. so like. Yes it is an academic job and 90% of his work is cultural preservation and historical analysis which is cool. but he is personally interested in heian era military strategies that he uses for cool boxing strategies cause he's a nerd. it just so happens that the documents he analyzes are ALSO wanted by the government and military for strategic purposes as well. so when sukuna comes across something they'd want he sends it over and gets a decent sum of cash as a Thanks. morally i do not support the military, but mundane!au sukuna is a little evil so...</li>
    <li><span><u>current project of interest:</u> he is looking at heian era court records about martial arts training that was most common in the higher ranks of that social hierarchy. analyzes lots of the literature from that era with major themes of wars, military, warrior culture</span></li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle; margin-top: 2px;">tries to take inspiration from what he gatherers from these texts and applies them to his boxing sessions. flexing those creative muscles. it's kind of working? he kicks toji's ass....</li>
    <li>i like the idea of him having poor eyesight and wearing glasses (insert four-eyes joke here)</li>
    <li>resident history buff</li>
    <li>is a member of his neighborhood boxing gym</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle; margin-top: 2px;">loves to spar, his gym bros are really kind, none match up his skill level though</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle; margin-top: 2px;">toji is his favorite sparring partner (toji is shameless and this amuses him)</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle; margin-top: 2px;">go on runs together when the weather gets nice… among other summertime activities. they go on a mountain hike at one point.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle; margin-top: 2px;">they have a cute moment on their hike where it's early morning in their tent (shared tent...) and sukuna wakes up before him. he doesn't move because he realized he likes watching toji sleep</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle; margin-top: 2px;">religiously attends the gym every weekend, boxing is the perfect outlet to release his energy. also (surprisingly) really helps with his back pain.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle; margin-top: 2px;">is always the one to beg the lady who owns the gym to open later so he and toji can fight some more... she will not listen to toji because she hates him.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle; margin-top: 2px;">imagine both of them half-arguing with each other while trying to convince her</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: none; margin-top: 2px;">toji: please can you give us fifteen more minutes this asshole has to be cheating.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: none; margin-top: 2px;">sukuna: please give me fifteen more minutes to show our princess what actual boxing looks like. (and she accepts)</li>
    <li>early riser</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle;">has a hard time falling asleep in unfamiliar places. if he is not sleeping in his own bed he sleeps very lightly and will wake up at the slightest sounds</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle;">the sun makes the scars on his face feel sensitive so if the sun is shining on his face in the morning it will wake him up</li>
    <li>before tojikuna gets married, he picked these rings out a few months after meeting toji and becoming... Friends or whatever you want to call it. the original reason was because yorozu just started working there and is so terribly irksome with her constant love letters and advances. not even uraume scares her off, which is impressive on its own</li>
    <li>really, he only needed one ring for the “i'm married” excuse, so why was he looking at sets? and why was he thinking of toji's ring-shaped tan line as he was shopping?</li>
    <li>the mark on toji's ring finger is what makes sukuna hesitate on making a move... he normally is shameless when it comes to things like this....</li>
    <li>he tries to imagine what that ring must have looked like... who wore the other ring... what she meant to him.....</li>
    <li>now that tjkn are married sukuna wears his ring all the time. except when he's boxing of course.</li>
    <li>goes through a fisherman phase!</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle; margin-top: 2px;">kenjaku: <a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/Kurozouua">sonia</a>, can you bring in sukuna's new intern? i want to talk to her about something</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: none; margin-top: 2px;">kenjaku: yorozu! let's chat!</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: none; margin-top: 2px;">yorozu: is this about another meeting with HR? i wish they'd stop calling me down there. it's so far our of the way and i don't understand their vague threats.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: none; margin-top: 2px;">kenjaku: so i heard your love letters weren't doing the trick :( don't lose hope! (<i>seriously imagine this as two girlies sitting at a mall food court table and kenjaku is leaned in chin rested on shoulder pouting as she tries to Girl Talk Friendship her way into making sukuna's life more unbearable</i>) trust me i've known sukuna for ages and i can tell when he's playing hard to get. i'll let you in on a little secret... sukuna loves gifts. he will surely reciprocate your feelings if you get him the right treasures.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: none; margin-top: 2px;">yorozu, at T.J. Maxx: what do men even like to do? [sees <a class="link" href="/images/jjk-shrine/mundane/mug.png" target="_blank">fishing mug</a>] sukuna loves coffee. sukuna loves men. this is perfect. (</i>she has no idea sukuna likes to fish. she doesn't know anything about sukuna's personality. i love this brand of obsession</i>)</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: none; margin-top: 2px;">(<i>sukuna finds this mug on his desk and really loves it. doesn't even care that it's from that intern. drinks out of it every. single. day. at home. not at work. duh</i>)</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: none; margin-top: 2px;">toji and yuki bet on how long this fisherman phase will last. toji bets 3 months. yuki bet 1 year. yuki won. dedicated fisherman sukuna is real.</li>
    <li>thinking about sukuna and uraume having a very weird and codependent friendship is pretty hilarious actually...</li>
    <li>uraume needs to be by his side at all times or else they will start to break out into hives (an exaggeration) and if sukuna spends an entire day without uraume he feels so disoriented like he would be unable to function normally.. sukuna doesn't even know how the coffee machine in his office works. it's uraume's coffee machine. they always use it to make his coffee. because. it's uraume. duh. stop entertaining the idea of no uraume being around they'll always be around (heart rate increases slightly)</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle; margin-top: 2px;">it's even funnier that toji doesn't mind this. to him, uraume is such a little alien freak that it seems normal for them to have this weird thing going on with sukuna. he feels soooo “whatever” about them. like what is he gonna do? nothing.</li>
    <li>when tjkn got married and moved in together, sukuna wanted so badly to ask if uraume could move in with them but was concerned it might be too weird of an ask. toji eventually caught onto this which is why he invited uraume to move in with them without bothering to ask sukuna about it beforehand because he knew he'd say Yes</li>

            <p style="font-size: small;">Uraume teaches Toji how to cook for Sukuna, since those two are married after all and Sukuna loves a good meal at the end of his busy days.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle;">i'm obsessed with grumpy men doing kind things in the meanest way possible to seem Nonchalant... like, toji brings in a bed and a dresser into the spare room they originally used as a second sitting room and the next morning he's abruptly woken up by Uraume's yelling and is really mad about it and he's just like: for Fuck's sake. why are you always here? you might as well move in this is ridiculous.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle;">uraume thinks toji is being sarcastic as usual until they see the new room and they're like: <i>Wahoo! Free rent AND close proximity to Sukuna! I win!</i> and flops on the bed joyously</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle;">they eventually start to warm up to toji when he took PTO one day, got bored, went to sukuna's office to hang out and spent a good forty minutes in the break room shit talking yorozu and kenjaku with them... (tojisukume shit talking sessions get absolutely nasty... no holding back whatsoever they talk shit like its 2009 and it's enough to make me cry)</li>
    <li>has never paid for anything at all in their life (besides the wedding gift plants)</li>
    <li>how Uraume paid for rent and living expenses before moving in with tjkn will remain a mystery...</li>
    <li>uraume toji dynamic is fun. they both think “god, what a freak. i'm glad i'm the normal one here” about each other</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>is also a member of the same boxing gym sukuna goes to</li>
    <li>enjoying sparring because it feels productive</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle;">he likes the fact that he feels like he learns new things after every match</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle;">actually wants to get better (sore loser)</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle;">is called Princess frequently (always blocking his face when he fights)</li>
    <li style="padding-right: 5px;">sukuna is his favorite sparring partner, he likes figuring out how to adapt to his weird fighting style. it's like, ancient.</li>
    <li>one weekend sukuna doesn't come to the gym... (<u>tojikuna interlude</u> begin!)</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle;">toji shows up at sukuna's place of work to get a hold of his number or something, unfortunately the first person he runs into is kenjaku (who is not in his own department... where he is supposed to be)</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle;">once toji asks kenjaku about sukuna he immediately starts spewing lie after lie to send him off on a wild goose chase</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle;">kenjaku has never met this man before. he literally has no reason to do this other than it would be funny</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle;">toji comes back pissed off after the third Chase like “he wasn't there either... why are you fucking with me?” to which kenjaku responds “i don't know why you keep believing me”</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle;">next weekend toji is giving sukuna death glares (sukuna chalks up toji's punches hitting harder than usual to a new workout routine?)</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle;">water bottle sharing indirect kiss yeah yeah</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle;">are often seen tightening each other's handwraps. you might hear them bickering because one keeps asking the other to re-do his hand if it's night tight enough "it's perfectly fine sukuna" met with "no it's not and i'm not going to let you be the cause of a wrist injury. re-do it. i'm not in a rush..."</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle;">refuses to tell sukuna where he got his scar from (wants to keep up the mystery so sukuna stays interested. he likes when he asks him questions about himself...)</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle;">they're so utterly disgusting about this. "where'd you get that scar?" "where'd you get yours" like... they are gross i hate them</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle;">sukuna doesn't take toji seriously at first as a fighter, toji has a really fun time adapting to sukuna's fighting technique. wants to ask him about this later if he will share..</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle;"><span><a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/track/01T0Kq5YOIRF9BQRXJsyfe?si=35c3690a5ecc425c">their relationship development taking place over</a> a series of many boxing sessions, post boxing workout sessions, and the occasional work visit?! where the words “don't hold back on me now” and “i can take it” are constantly thrown around is so Perfect for them here</span></li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle; ">am i talking about their boxing relationship or sexual relationship? yeah</li>
    <li>works in the office monday through wednesday and works remotely from home thursday through sunday. he takes most saturdays off. i wish i had this work schedule</li>
    <li>eats while on the phone</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle; "><strong>toji:</strong> [schlurp, audible swallow] “emergency services how can i—”</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: none;"><strong>caller:</strong> someone is in my house I think I'm getting robbed help my address is [...]</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: none; "><strong>toji:</strong> uh, i've seen those housing prices, miss, no one is robbing you. just turn on the light i bet it's your roommate again [hits end call button on headset]</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 40px; list-style-type: circle;">more lore on this: this caller ended up being the lady who own the boxing gym he attends. she figured this out which is why i said she hates him earlier</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 40px; list-style-type: circle; ">eventually starts sending sukuna to beg for her to open later because she won't say yes to him if he's there</li>
    <li>snarky and mean to non-emergency callers but not rude enough to get fired over it</li>
    <li>can't cook</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle;">when uraume moves in with tjkn household, they try to teach toji some of the basics</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle;">it's not very successful but toji can now make breakfast for One (egg sandwich) and has sort of bonded with uraume in the process</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle;">still can't cook a meal on his own, though...</li>
    <li>dead wife</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle; ">she was the only reason why he stayed in [old town name] because his family hates his guts and treated him terribly. he only stayed there to appease her. it was truly miserable having to look at their ugly mugs every day so he skipped town to just be able to breathe for a moment. her family owns a very popular local chinese restaurant and like the restaurant competition is SERIOUS over there so everybody knows their family and they are popular in their area and whatnot. which means the whole neighborhood secretly hates toji's ass like think suburban gossip cliques yk?</li>
    <li>the boxing gym in his new neighborhood is his haven</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle;">right after mamaguro died he sort of got into street fighting. but not too deep in it. "street fighting" as in bar fights almost every night.. in the street. it just wasn't for him, though. (too far into street fighter toji wouldn't fit the realm of the mundane anymore so...)</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle;">once he moved, he discovered boxing in a more controlled setting is way more fun. more room to breathe. sober enough to think. its a fun mental and physical exercise. still a dirty fighter but is growing out of it</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 30px; list-style-type: square;"><i>toji who walked around <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3Pzh926pXggbMe2ZpXyMV7?si=b4fe1b25113748ab">with a chip on his shoulder</a>, moving through what felt like a haze for months, potentially a year, maybe two (time just continues to move past him but he remains stagnant), finding a place just to relieve stress and then winding up with something much more</i> (god bless <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://twitter.com/kentofication?s=20">yu</a> for this one)</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 30px; list-style-type: square;"><i>do you ever think that when toji does start feeling a little spark, a little inkling that there's something there between him and sukuna, he feels - bad? when he and mamaguro got married, they promised for forever, but when her forever was cut short, he was forced to carry the torch for both of them. and he has tirelessly done so since then. by keeping her picture on his nightstand and at the front door, wishing her goodnight, good morning, goodbye and hello. by keeping her ring right next to his on a chain around his neck, right over her heart. he's loved her for years and cannot imagine loving her for far more. and so when something new blooms in his heart, is he scared that he must let go a part of her in order to make space? that it becomes even more dangerous the more times they spend together, the more he feels relaxed, comfortable, and just happy once again? or do you think he'll realize that he was never forced to carry the torch of his and his wife's love but instead bore that burden himself? that once he began to feel like he had to carry on her memory by mourning for the rest of their initially promised forever, suddenly he lost sight of once was and what should've been. <u>that love was meant to be unconditional and that he would continue to love her and the memory of her even if he begins to love another.</u></i> (oh my god yu back at it again. they are incredible)</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 30px; list-style-type: square;">has a small shrine dedicated to his late wife in his house</li>
    <li>a married man (to sukuna...)</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle;">wears his ring on his right hand (as yu says: <i>not overriding the past but still looking forwards the future</i>). when they hold hands the rings clink (thanks mizu)</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle;">mostly wears his ring on a necklace, though</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle;">has their wedding photos pinned up on the walls of his caller cubicle. and one photo of toji winning one round of boxing. his proudest moment.</li>
    <li>has no social media presence at all. no accounts. nonexistent. i envy him.</li>
    <li>goes on vaguely religious rambles when he's drunk. it's a sunday night after he just sparred with sukuna for the first time and he's at a bar with yuki and toji's like “the lord has really blessed him. and i'm not talking about his sneezing, either.” yuki laughs so hard at this she chokes on her drink (when i heard this line i laughed so hard i choked on my drink)</li>
    <li>toji visits sukuna at work on occasion (rare) (when he is really, really bored)</li>
    <img src="images/jjk-shrine/mundane/mundane_tjkn.png" style="height: 180px; float: left;">
    <li>one time he was feeling particularly silly and dressed up in sukuna's work clothes (which are way too big for him) and his glasses and he pushes his hair back and is like “this is what you look like” and squints and furrows his brows. sukuna is like “i do not look like that”</li>
    <li><i>what's with the old man face? sukuna you ARE an old man</i> (made me giggle)</li>
    <li>on a similar note, when toji fights with his girlfriend sukuna he always looks at her through a fork and imagines she's in jail, which heals toji mentally <a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/tojishole/status/1684072703618347008" target="_blank">please click this link to see mizu's doodle of this</a> that i've adopted into the mundane au canon</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle;">uraume didn't find the joke funny so when they saw toji engage in this silliness they took away all the forks in the house. they remained forkless for the week. sukuna didn't notice.</li>
    <li>his beef with the lady who owns the boxing gym (i've GOT to give her a name already, like damn) is so inconvenient and toji just wants to ask for more time without getting looked at like he killed her dog (he's not <i>that</i> sorry about the 911 incident but like... he's willing to pretend to be at this point)</li>
    <li>was born without his left arm and has had a <u>prosthetic arm</u> for his whole life. when he was younger, mamaguro would tease him by saying his arm was eaten by a dragon in a different life. or make up other stories like he was a war hero who lost his arm in battle.. or a spy that was captured by the enemy and lost his arm to protect his nation's secrets.. they're all so cheesy but he found them so endearing.</li>

<ul>
    <li>originally applied to intern at the natural sciences division (where kenjaku works) to get her hands on some good entomology research opportunities</li>
    <li>often spends her weekends foraging in different wildlife areas in the city... alone usually</li>
    <li>the spot she was aiming for filled up, so she settled for the next opening they had... with sukuna!</li>
    <li>her main job is to make sukuna miserable</li>
    <li>helps digitize most of the records in their collection</li>
    <br>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle;">other job responsibilities include: translating the heian era literature sukuna is in charge of to different languages (although she's actually quite bad at this, sukuna eventually took her off this job), dodge uraume during their surprise visits (their altercations are worse than uraume and kenjaku's), and other side projects</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle;">is personally interested in developing educational materials, but it's not a priority for the department (it's really sad.. they won't let her have anything!)</li>
    <li>thinks the HR department loves her (why else would they call me into the office  all the time?) it is unknown how she still has a job here</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle;">uraume: if i have to attend one more sexual harassment training because of her im going to forcibly send her to a papal cloister. i've been researching a few nearby. (uraume doesn't even work there. they don't have to attend the meetings)</li>
    <li>hides love letters in between ancient scrolls that sukuna has to analyze. thinks she's being cute. sukuna doesn't even read them</li>
    <li>has never come to work in accordance to the dress code in her life</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle;">talking to her about it is like talking to a brick wall she simply cannot hear you. “sorry my tits are in the way, what did you say? i can't hear you”</li>
    <li>listening to her and Uraume argue with each other actually gives me second hand embarrassment. they sound like they are fourteen. uraume sneaks up behind Yorozu as she's trying to sneak come candid photos of sukuna at his desk (freak!) and Uraume tries to grab her phone but they end up pulling back and forth like children. uraume bends her pinkie back as yorozu begs “please don't tell please please please” as uraume gets the phone and deletes the picture. sukuna literally doesn't care.</li>

    <li>has complicated feelings about sex and sexuality. in the 'rarely wakes up in her own bed' kind of way....</li>
    <li>kicks toji's ass at the gym when sukuna is not there. she's just really good and toji is really fun to spar with. also she actually likes him. weird right?</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle; margin-top: 2px;">toji yuki friendship!!! toji is very unlikeable and Yuki is very likable so the fact that these two tolerate each other is grounds for a fun little social experiment..</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle; margin-top: 2px;">first meet at the gym but start to see each other more at the drag bar yuki frequents, where she's really close with bartender kiyooo (ijichi)..... toji wouldn't say that bar is his first choice but yuki is very convincing and toji would never turn down free drinks, duh</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 5px; list-style-type: circle; margin-top: 2px;">yuki is actually toji's first best friend. besides sukuna he doesn't count.</li>
    <li>is really sick of sukuna and toji's antics at the gym</li>
    <li>yuki's car has a SITUATIONSHIP SURVIVOR bumper sticker on it except the back of her car is extremely dented because Someone rear ended her last week.... lol</li>
