    <p>'slow it downnn make it bouncy' changed lives. my favorite release from them so far, honestly. i think it's the only full album in all of k-pop where i don't skip a single song... which is very rare. can't think of another one off the top of my head right now so. good job ateez.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>favorite tracks:</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPYX2y4NzTU" target="_blank" class="link">Flip That</a> & <a href="https://youtu.be/BIjidKQfW_8?list=OLAK5uy_lclfzGw-7t4NUfAjdGTU_SyixodZb8G5w" target="_blank" class="link">Pale Blue Dot</a></p>
    <p>a tragic event happen while i was flipping through flip that... the pages flipped out and tore from the binding! (i tried a little alliteration...) which is actually pretty disappointing given i rarely ever open these photobooks and i have never bent or flattened this one in particular, so i was really surprised (in a not so good way) that the pages started falling out. but hey, at least these scans look great for the most part! loona's last group album deteriorating as the group fell apart is poetic, in a sense...</p>
