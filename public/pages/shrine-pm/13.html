    <p>loona's last album release before they disbanded (thank god... at least they're finally free from that wretched company). such a cute fun summertime album i really loved this album a lot. and it feels like a good way to end this Chapter of their Lives... as dramatic as that may sound. gettin' on that magic train to freedom! lmao.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>favorite tracks:</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPYX2y4NzTU" target="_blank" class="link">Flip That</a> & <a href="https://youtu.be/BIjidKQfW_8?list=OLAK5uy_lclfzGw-7t4NUfAjdGTU_SyixodZb8G5w" target="_blank" class="link">Pale Blue Dot</a></p>
    <p>a tragic event happen while i was flipping through flip that... the pages flipped out and tore from the binding! (i tried a little alliteration...) which is actually pretty disappointing given i rarely ever open these photobooks and i have never bent or flattened this one in particular, so i was really surprised (in a not so good way) that the pages started falling out. but hey, at least these scans look great for the most part! loona's last group album deteriorating as the group fell apart is poetic, in a sense...</p>
