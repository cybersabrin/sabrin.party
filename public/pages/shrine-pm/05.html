    </span></h1>
    <p>found this gem at goodwill the week i got back home from my trip to the summer, so i saw this as a Good Omen for sure. i haven't listened to <i>much</i> meat loaf but from what i've listened to so far, i really love. dad rock hits like nothing else, truly.</p>

    <p><strong>favorite tracks:</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIpoSrdNZrM" target="_blank" class="link">If This Is The Last Kiss</a> & <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Czj52CJwL4" target="_blank" class="link">Original Sin</a></p>
    <p>i was so charmed by the booklet that came with this CD. each track and lyrics page has their own book cover design illustration that i'm just so obsessed with.</p>
    <p>it's hard for me to explain it, but meat loaf's songs have such strong narratives, i just get so immersed in the <i>stories</i> each song has to offer, which is something i really love. i group this album with glass animals' how to be a human being album in the <i>songs i can visually See</i> category. and these book cover illustrations that are included in the booklet totally play into that! i just love this CD so much... excellent packaging. such a fun concept. a work of Art...</p>
