<p>Lue is my lovely whimsical woodsy elf with a big heart and a hollow brain. A mischievous little thing, whether it's snagging shiny trinkets she finds or chasing after woodland critters. She's all about living in the moment. She does not have the patience for waiting around or making elaborate plans... She's more of a shoot first, ask questions later kinda gal (and she wonders why people seem to find her so intimidating...). But that's something she's working on. Surely. </p>
<p>When it comes to making animal friends, Lue's heart is in the right place, but her attempts to befriend the creatures of the forest usually end in chaos... or worse. Think gettinginto some serious beef with Timber the squirrel and accidentally killing the blue bird she tried to, uh, diagnose... It's not pretty, but it sure keeps things interesting. Luckily, Lue's got her trusty companions—Charm, Heren, and Gale—to keep her in check and serve as her moral compass when decisions get more difficult. They've been through it all with Lue, from her scatterbrained antics to... more scatterbrained antics.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>This is what I'd count as my first <i>real</i> BG3 run, and I'm so glad I'm doing this with friends... It's my first D&D adjascent game I've played, and I really love being able to have fun with creating my own character and storyline and such. I've grown really attatched to Lue. Fun Fact: Her hilariously low intelligence stat was completely an accident. I was rushing through building her character because I wanted to hurry up and get ready to play with my friends and I didn't realize I made her stupid. I'm glad I did though, she's my precious girl. Some brawn, no brain.</p>

<h3 style=background-color:#7d9620;padding:5px>session notes</h3>
<p>This is the part where I dump all the notes and/or highlights I remembered to write down during our sessions. This was not necessarily made for Consumption, so please don't expect good writing from me, I just want to be able to come back here and giggle at my first D&D adventure with friends...</p>
<p><strong>session one:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>charm kissed mindflayer and everyone died</li>
<li>heren slipping and falling and stumbling and tripping literally everywhere</li>
<li>lue got robbed by children and threatened to beat them up if they didn't give her stuff back</li>
<li>lue also walked into a trap and got her and gale killed</li>
<li>a huge perk from this experience was that we learned about gale's 736482 step instruction manual on how to revive him that no one will ever use</li>
<li>oh lue also probed the bird after charm said not too (she was just trying to diagnose!!) and accidentally killed it.. worst thing to ever happen to lue</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>session two:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>raphael showed up at this random outpost we've never been to before! heren you lucky duck!</li>
<li>lue and gale got left behind because they were lagging behind the rest of the gang.. so they never even got to meet the guy!</li>
<li>while they were gone lue had gale give her a ton of new ear piercings. they were bored..</li>
<li>karlach and her engine heart would make a great party trick, according to lue. she hopes they will become great friends</li>
<li>lue was walking towards gale and she randomly said “always makes my day better” i nearly cried that was so cute</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>session three:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>lue passed an intelligence check! a rare win</li>
<li>lue is very proud of herself for freeing that random prisoner. her good deed of the day</li>
<li>heren deemed Friend of Nature by halsin. bonus friendship points w lue were earned because of this</li>
<li>heren stole minthara's armor and ended up stealing all of her clothes by accident, leaving her naked and knocked out on the floor. oops.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>session four:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>charm wakes up bloodless is the equivalent of the Walk Of Shame.. everybody knows she let astarion hit</li>
<li>we struggled.</li>
<li>we killed nere lowkey for nothing</li>
<li>lue got a lobotomy (i have put way too much thought into lue's “let's play doctor” event with volo.. since all she knows is natural medicinal practices that Everybody can do, she doesn't realize being a regular doctor requires special skills volo does not have. so like.. she assumes this is a very normal doctors visit and goes along with it. just to see. her only thought was “this hurts so bad i understand why humans only see their healers once a year”.. she hated it. but she was even more sad that no one noticed her subtle change in eye color. she already had homophobia in her eyes but her brown eye is now blue and no one commented on it.. not even gale.. or scratch.. or astarion. she thought maybe astarion could call her stupid since she noticed he disapproved but Nothing..)</li>
</ul>
