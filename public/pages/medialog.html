            <img src=/pics/library/thelegacy.png class=cover>
            <p>i have no idea what this movie was about i watched it for dawna lee heising and zoned out for the rest of the movie. the sound effects were so jarring i got a little freaked out! so eerie... the editing was really charming though i was a big fan of that. otherwise the movie was a bore i was just waiting for it to be over.</p>

            <img src=/pics/library/methgator.png class=cover>
            <p>save me tojikuna creature films.. save me.. (i wasn't saved) this one also sucked! but i liked it more than cocaine shark because there was way more meth gator in this which was great. but still, not enough gator. i think the main reason why i'm always so disappointed in these creature films is that they are never actually centered on the creature. don't show me people trying to stop the meth gator i want 80 minutes of gator internal monologue as he grapples with his unexpected drug addiction and hunger for blood. i think out of all the drugged up animal movie's i've seen so far, cocaine bear is still definitely my favorite. i watched it theaters opening weekend cause they were giving out free gummy bears and i loved it.. so much bear and so much silly campy gore.</p>

            <p>i don't know what i expected here to be honest.. but whatever it was, it wasn't that. i so desperately wished we got more than 20 seconds of cocaine shark screentime. i think he had a hawaiian shirt on? i know for a fact he had abs. which is hilarious but it was so dark we barely saw any more of the shark. the rest of the movie was pretty boring with some guy talking about how he wants to become a shark.. or that he feels he is a shark? i wasn't really paying attention to be honest.. not enough shark.</p>

            <img src=/pics/library/aoc.png class=cover>
            <p>sighs... for the amount of complete and utter nonsense this movie showed me i could not stop watching.. i had so many questions i so desperately wanted answers to. like.. when are the aliens going to show up? will that hat lady ever find jack? did the editor really just use every single iMovie transition animation they had available in the span of 45 seconds? will i ever find love like pooty and baby jizz? maybe not.</p>
            <p>i loved the use of popeye cartoon clips and the music so loud you can't hear the dialogue and fantastic cinematography at work here. also the big time rush esque sound effects were incredible. pooty was the shining star of the story she is absolutely incredible and hilarious. i wish dakota did not exist. the absurdity of this movie was so captivating i almost forgot about the fact that there are ZERO aliens in this movie. ZERO!!!!!! well like sorta but NOT REALLY!!!!!!</p>

            <img src=/pics/library/mmvamp.png class=cover>
            <p>another misty mundae movie for the books. not as good as <i>spiderbabe</i> but i still enjoyed this one a lot. a very unserious movie about caroline who begrudgingly flies to paris after her grandma dies, gets mugged, and then taken in by super hot lesbian isabelle as they fall in love and commit murder-robberies together. isabelle is the vampire of course and she eventually eats caroline. their dynamic was actually so fun in this... some real quality girl yaoi here, which was a very pleasant surprise. i also watched <i>an erotic werewolf in london</i> but i'm not even gonna bother logging it on here because i didn't like it as much. wayyy too much porn not enough plot... there was a lady werewolf. shrugs. i skipped through like the whole thing lmfao.</p>

            <img src=/pics/library/darkangel.png class=cover>
            <p>this may be another new comfort movie. the vibes of this one were just sooo good. even if the movie bored me at times. it was still a great watch. veronica is fantastic. she just ascended from hell (ran away from home) showed up in like new york city or whatever, watched some tv, immediately saw how fucked everything is and started killing cops on her way to ruin the mayor's life. a demon doing more for justice than our electoral system hell yeah. she was so efficient. so creative. so effective. i loved watching her question our world as she does nothing whatsoever to hide the fact that she is from hell. amazing stuff. and she even finds a hot doctor boyfriend along the way. what more could you possibly ask for?! <i>to turn away from evil is to be an accomplice to evil</i> - veronica</p>

            <p>this was such an enjoyable little short film. this woman has two boyfriends, one rich and one poor. which, as i was watching by the way, i forgot this was the 80s so i thought the boyfriend with the silly hat was the rich one at first. because he dressed like a hippie. and then they showed guy #2 with a suit and then it clicked. and both of them refuse to let her drive her own car!! and it's like what the hell are these entitled freaks on about.. let her drive the damn car! and then she does and we learn why she is not allowed to drive the damn car. soooo true! sooo real! the music was really good also. fun style!</p>

            <p>the erotic misadventures of the invisible man (2003)</p>
            <img src=/pics/library/invisibleman.png class=cover>
            <p>y'all. i almost didn't put this on here but i need you to know that this movie right here is an overlooked cultural relic. this is a horny movie about an invisible man who is like, great at sex or whatever. who cares that's literally not the point of this entry at all. in this movie, there is a man in a duck costume who walks into a bar, and asks the bartender: Hey! Got any grapes? and the bartender does not have any grapes. mind you, i'm watching this, zooted, sleep-deprived, and i'm just like wow okay. duck song reference. ten minutes later they cut to the bar again and the duck walks in again and asks for grapes. the bartender has no grapes. they basically go through the full story. then i see the year of this movie, 2003, and the year the duck song was released on youtube, 2009. and then i am cursed with the knowledge that <strong>the duck song ripped off the erotic misadventures of the invisible man. they made the song based off this movie.</strong> and my mind was blown. i told everybody i know about it like i'm the village religious fanatic shaking his fists and yelling about god. it's so stupid. but so important. i don't like that i have this information. it feels like cursed information.</p>

            <p>who knew aunty ida was the founder and lead commanding officer of the fujo army?!?! anyways, divine as dawn davenport was absolutely mesmerizing in this movie.. she is so beautiful... i thought this was thrilling.. her life story. fascinating and hilarious. i couldn't take my eyes off the screen this movie didn't father for a second. the dialogue was so smart and funny. i remember listening to a podcast where john waters talked about how as a kid he used to "play car crash" so seeing that here with the beloved miss taffy was great. <i>but my life is a show!</i> was so real coming from dawn... preach! i am just soo in love with how this movie manages to be so deeply serious in its unseriousness. beautiful.</p>

            <p>the premise of this one was more amusing than the movie itself overall, but i didn't hate it. i was bored during most of it but had the most fun watching the theatrical murders take place. i was watching on the big tv and my mom walked in during the moment one guy's dead was being decapitated while he slept and my mother was horrified. she asked me why i was laughing... it was funny! i totally understand why this guy would completely lose his mind and kill everyone who disagrees with his work. i feel like him at least 2x a week.</p>

            <p>i actually had so much fun with this one. at least, more than i was expecting. i had to skip through a lot of the porn to really enjoy it. but it was actually a great werewolf movie! it was really goofy, the dead boyfriend was <i>actually</i> funny (rare) and i loved seeing him pop in to give sarah some tips on how to kill herself as his body slowly deteriorated... "let me leave before i... lose face" as his face was melting off was just great. plus the gore and special effects were so fun! and the werewolf transformation sequence was gnarly. would i re-watch? maybe? yeah. yeah i would.</p>

            <p>this one was pretty bad but i still liked it. i feel like this movie would definitely be something pre-teen me would have latched onto in an obsessive way. it was super homoerotic and the friendship breakup was so intense. but the movie was just so much longer than it needed to be. the repeated camp counsellor announcement (and the song that goes with it) made it feel like i was actually spending the summer there-- and that's not a good thing. there were so many songs with like. lyrics. where you'd expect instrumental music? it was so strange. this is definitely something i'd re-watch though, i think. i like it in a weird way. i mean. who wouldn't sorta enjoy horse girl lesbian brokeback mountain?</p>

            <p>i had high expectations for this one and was a little disappointed. very disappointed... it was cute and camp and i loved the space girls' hair. it was so big and colorful and amazing. wish a planet full of hot aliens like that existed in irl. they were all so gorgeous. but the movie totally missed the opportunity to be even more fun and gay. the lady planet needs men to repopulate so they accidentally land in earth (ugh!) and settle for this awful playboy guy instead. which is like, fine. i wouldn't have minded that at all if the narrative wasn't so focused on this man. i didn't care about him at all. he wasn't funny or interesting. i wanted more space girls screen time and more sisterhood and more girl love.... so. disappointing but visually pleasing, at least.</p>

            <img src=/pics/library/aous.png class=cover>
            <p>a real movie this time. this one was sad. i didn't <i>love</i> it, not for any serious reason but it didn't particularly yank at my heartstrings the way other tragedies do, but it was still pretty good. honestly my favorite part of the movie were the transitions. they were sooo fluid and so seamless it did a great job at blurring the line between memories and reality. and when the memories of his parents or of harry went away and we see that the main guy is alone again the feelings of loss are sooo strong. the transitions just do a great job with that. beautifully done. i do think it's hilarious that i knew harry would kill himself that night precisely 10 minutes into the movie. flo tried to redirect me but i knew... i called it. </p>

            <p>i couldn't tell if this was a tv show pilot or a movie. but i this this was the one that had a lot of the same actors that were in horndog beach party so that was fun. i don't remember much about this movie other than it was about some struggling actors and that the sound effects were hilarious. the guy in charge of the soundboard was playing the laugh track after every other sentence spoken it was great. and when dawna lee heising appeared the crowd went WILD which was very fitting. it's what she deserves. so overall a fun watch. even though i don't remember what happens.</p>

            <p>hell yeah another movie with dawna lee heising in it. this is so healing. miss perkins is beautiful and gorgeous i love her. the only other jared masters movie i've seen (i think?) was slink which was great because so many of the actors reappeared here. it's fun recognizing them lmfao. first of all i wanted to point out how actually incredibly cute and creative the opening credits were?? the handwritten burn book esque concept was so fun i loved it! the dialogue here was also so absurd i couldn't stop laughing. for the first like half hour? hour? or so i was like <i>THIS</i> is my kinda brainrot film.. <i><strong>what was that? uh i dunno some psycho mass murderer killer?</strong></i> like.. yea man. the beginning was pretty great and i was loving it but i started to get bored during the actual massacre part which is... telling, i think. i really could have done without the existence of that fucking freak boyfriend guy who literally sexually assaulted a girl that was passed out? and no one gave a fuck obviously and it was treated as if they were hooking up. when she was. unconscious. gross! literally so gross and unnecessary. ew. also i'm pretty sure this movie had a lesbian subplot too but it's too homophobic to tell... i ♡ 2014!</p>

            <img src=/pics/library/spm2.png class=cover>
            <p>i liked this one way more! now that i have something to compare it to i can safely say the first slumber party massacre was kinda dogshit. i was absolutely obsessed with the girl who cannot read the room for the life of her and keeps talking about her zits when her friend is clearly going through a bad time. sally. love her. she's just living in her own world! that's all! i also think the rockstar that's been torturing courtney about Going All The Way was really funny. made use of the whole drilling bit. if you're gonna make a slasher about the devilish act of premarital penetrative sex you might as well be funny about it! and the performance he gave?! incredible! lets buzz! <i>i can't get no... satisfaction</i> was hilarious. maybe my sense of humor is absolute garbage. but i don't care.</p>

            <img src=/pics/library/spm.png class=cover>
            <p>this was a really fun movie. very simple in a lot of ways but i thought it was cute. a very 80s camp slasher horror. i had it on the background as i was cleaning my room because i didn't think it would be serious but i did get into it. it wasn't the story that was necessarily interesting moreso the characters themselves. so it was fun! i did eventually need to start cleaning my room so i wasn't paying much attention but i still think it counts. i'm gonna watch the second one too. i read some people were saying this was gay and i don't think i was paying attention by that point, whoops. maybe i should rewatch? and not clean my room this time... i also saw there's a 2021 remake so i want to watch that too. i'm invested in the slumber party massacre franchise i guess.</p>

            <p>giuseppe andrews is one weird dude. i liked this one though. there's something really touching about this functionally dysfunctional family living together as they cope with their abandoned dreams and also a murder. kitty the singing 20 year old and her failed rapper boyfriend Richard formerly known as PO Box were especially charming. my favorite scene was the tangent where richard was talking about cryogenics and miss kitty was like thats fucking stupid and richard was like well duh its stupid but that's just how those rich people think! i love a moment taken to make fun of rich people. it was great. i still don't know what Gwank is and quite frankly, i really don't give a fuck either.</p>

            <p>basically if the phantom troupe from hxh was not really into murder. also, parker is quite literally the best most well written most perfect fictional character in the entire world. or at least, out of everything i've ever watched in my life. this was such an enjoyable watch. it's light, it's silly, but the characters are so loveable i haven't been attached to characters like this in so long. they are just the perfect comfort characters. hardison parker eliot (OT3) dynamic is something so special. they take care of each other. they just make me so happy. sophie took a bit to warm up to me in the early seasons but she's literally my wife and i will kill nate for her. just saying. this entry isn't as thorough as i wanted it to be because i'm sleepy but. this was such a feel good show. i loved it. i love these characters. i love parker's rise to power. i'd die for her. top ten characters of all time.</p>

            <p>surprisingly charming with some beautiful cinematography, which i really wasn't expecting. i loved the red lighting they used indoors it gave the feeling that nowhere was safe. i feel like if i watched this as a kid it would have really stuck with me. my one complaint is that i wish this movie was gloopier and gloppier, but i think the lack of gore is due to the fact that they probably used up their entire budget on making this sick ass pumpkinhead monster creature, so i'll forgive it. some great dialogue too, like: "only god can save us from what's out there, kim" and then kim goes to the kitchen to grab two butcher knives and says, "in case god doesn't show up." an icon. hilarious. this feels like it should be a movie i ritualistically watch every halloween.</p>

            <img src="/pics/library/loc.png" class="cover">
            <p>this movie is so many levels of fucked up lmao. looking at the letterboxd reviews a lot of people hated it because of its awful misrepresentation of black metal, and that the guys this movie was based off are sensationalized and made to represent the entire community. which like is totally valid idk anything about black metal but i know it's not whatever they were doing in this movie. and i think this is the same thing they do with like, tv shows or movies about real serial killers and stuff. so like it sucks that this movie is continuing these harmful narratives about real shitty people. i don't know how much of the movie was real and how much was fake. so i don't know how seriously to take this movie lmao. i do think the two main guys would have saved so much time and energy if they just kissed each other instead of committing acts of terrorism but who am i to say anything. the movie was alright i guess?</p>
            <p>rory culkin was the perfect casting choice for the main character tho the movie poster is beautiful. it's sort of hard to describe but he looks so beautifully sad. this makeup art is incredible it's what made me watch the movie in the first place. that and my friend roisin told me to lmao. that is one good sad face on this lad. i also think the guy who plays varg did an incredible job at making me hate him. the scene where the reporter was like "so you're a paganist.. and a satanist... and a. nazi? that's a pretty broad belief system..." cracked me up. but otherwise yeah it was alright i guess, moral issues aside. I HATE THAT THEY CUT RORY CULKIN'S HAIR.</p>

            <img src="/pics/library/hannibal.png" class="cover">
            <p>i'm like eight years late to the party but i'm finally watching hannibal. loving it so far. this cannibal yaoi gets serious. i thought it would be queerbait because it's 2013 but they're really doing it here. they mean business! i think i've said this before on here, but i'm such a sucker for cyclical narratives and any sort of parallels ever so when will got shot in the exact same spot abigail's dad died and spoke <i>his</i> last words "see? see?" i knew i'd love this show. i don't even have much to really say right now other than i like it! it's entertaining! and really funny a lot of the time, though i'm not sure if it's intentional. my only complaint is that UGH most of the scenes are so dark i literally can't see what's going on with my screen brightness turned up to the max. why. why do they do this. let me see. anyways. i love mister hannibal he's so charming and fun. i love me a cannibal with class.</p>
            <p>update i just finished season 2 and it's so good but i'm not coherent so here are some notes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>i love seeing jack beat the fuck out of hannibal it's somehow so beautiful and i find their confrontations so satisfying.. like i know the main focus is on hannibal and will but they give a lot of weight to hannibal and jack's friendship too which is so valuable...</li>
                <li>i love how hannibal expresses his love through artistically displayed mutilated bodies & poetic monologues about love and desire and will expresses his love though Making An Appointment and saying things like I Fantasize About Killing You With My Hands…. a match made in heaven?</li>
                <li>their love is real not queerbait. season 2 finale mizumono.......... are you kidding me? "i let you in. i let you know me. see me. i gave you a gift and you didn't want it." "didn't i?" i was a wreck</li>
            </ul>
            <p>update now that i've finished: i can't tell if i've just been out of it or if season 3 just didn't live up to season 2... or maybe its because the season 2 finale was so incredible anything after felt weak in comparison? either way. i still loved the last couple episodes of the series. i was bummed that hannibal was captured and it felt like the series was stuck for a while. but i enjoyed his little jokes and sassy lines nonetheless. the series finale was incredible. if there's one thing these writers know how to do is write an end! i can't believe hannibal and will had hot steamy sloppy bloody sex and then will cried. very artistic.</p>

            <p><strong>"nah, i'm not an ass-kisser anymore. i'm an ass-eater."</strong> this movie is a gem. absolutely fucking hilarious. i mean. this woman gets called ugly at work so she shrinks (with a shrink gun) and eats every single woman who's prettier than her. this is incredible. stacy is so funny. and the scene inside stacy's stomach was actually pretty good? you know. didn't see it coming. the special effects are great. i love how bored all the women sound about getting shrunk and eaten alive. the acting was (terrible) phenomenal. i was a big fan of this one. update: i just found out this is like a kink movie. i had no idea i thought this was just a silly funny movie... what. wow. we live in a strange world. i thought this movie was so funny and unsexy i did not register this as a fetish movie at all. how strange. that in itself is also hilarious. let it be known i still liked that movie but just.. not in the way it was supposed to be enjoyed i guess. lmfaooooo.</p>

            <p>i've always had a fear of tanning beds ever since i watched this one horror movie in morocco with my cousins where the bed caught on fire and a broom fell on the beds so they couldn't be opened and two women burned alive inside. anyways this movie wasn't about that but it definitely didn't help with my anxieties about tanning beds. dawna lee heising hits some girl with a hammer to help her crazy husband make man-made (human skin) designer handbags. so obviously this movie was made for me. it was a dazzling load of garbage. the acting was so bad but so enjoyable to watch. the one girl in the beginning who told her friend to just, "max out that credit card already, who cares!" she gets it. i also love that this movie just had no conclusion at all. girl escapes and runs away but it just immediately starts rolling the end credits and we know nothing. i mean who cares really. we don't need to know. i don't care what happened to her i just am glad i had a good time. so silly. so entertaining.</p>

            <p>like, okay. i get this movie. i get it. it's a sorta campy (intentional camp, which is what makes it weird) story about the absurdity of the entertainment industry. i get it. it's a cool idea. but for some reason (i know the reason) it took me three days to get through this movie. i could not stay engaged for more than 10 minutes at a time, and i think it's because the story felt like it was going nowhere? visually it was Dazzling but everything else felt so colorless. i didn't care about any of the characters. the potential for girl yaoi fell flat when there was no real emotion behind nomi pushing cristal down the stairs. they could had something weird and twisted and fun but it was like... an empty wet sad cardboard box instead of emotion. i don't know if i'm making much sense. so i didn't really like this one. but i was so determined to see it through the end. i just let it play in the background while i cleaned my room.</p>

            <p>stop!! hibari-kun!</p>
            <img src=/pics/library/stophibarikun.png class=cover>
            <p>starting an entry before i even finish this series because oh my GOD. i honestly cannot believe i haven't heard about this absolute gem of an animanga until now?! our lovely main character, hibari is the coolest funniest prettiest most perfectest (trans!!) girl in the world. and this was written in the 80s! i'm about 5 eps in so far and am constantly overwhelmed by how cute and wonderful and amazing this show is. i'm also reading the manga alongside it because i literally can't get enough of this girl. though its still important to note that because this was made in the 80s, there are unfortunate instances of gross racist caricatures here and there which are pretty upsetting.. besides the casual transphobia from her family, hibari passes as a girl at school so everyone loves her and her love interest (kosaku) really actually likes her! and he knows she's trans! as of now he's still processing lol but i love the little moments he has where he's like "for some strange reason i'm really glad hibari didn't change..." its just. so cute and so healing. and watching this after just having seen love exposure is great. i am now officially on a roll of consuming trans girl media. 2024 is off to a great start.</p>
            <p><u>update as of late february:</u> the racism got so bad it's actually unwatchable so i think we're just going to stop. it's actually so unfortunate because the show had such a promising start. i've been reading a little bit of the manga to compare the two and it's insane how wildly different they are. the original manga is way better, way less racist. i still have more to read but a majority of the gross racist bits were added onto the anime, not originally written by the mangaka. so that's something i guess.</p>

            <p>a real movie for once! woah! i liked poor things a lot. the funny thing is throughout this whole movie i was constantly being reminded of dogtooth and told my friend flo we needed to watch that next. and turns out poor things and dogtooth were made by the same guy! i had no idea but i feel smart for making this connection anyways. everything about this movie was so much fun! the doll-like house interior and the set of portugal and the old-timey frankenstein themes were a joy to see. i also loved the chimera-fication of every aspect of this movie from the language (switching from the old timey to the doll esque to the modern talk) to the costumes (mishmash of eras all in one setting). it was great. the only thing i didn't love was the whole ex-husband story arc it felt like it was shoved to the end at the last minute and rushed to conclude. felt like it came out of nowhere. this is my issue with like, every real movie ever. that's why i started watching shit movies. they're just better...</p>

            <p>this was a pretty fun watch actually. kinda yuri also. tween girls get amputated and replaced limbs with sick machine guns and other weapons. the gore special effects were so goofy it gave it made the whole thing seem more Fun and less of an attempt at horror. the drill bra was incredible!!! my chosen method of death tbh. who wouldn't want to get shredded by a hot mafia milf? i also watched the sequel (?) the twenty minute spin-off called <u>shyness machine girl</u> which was even sillier and more ridiculous. but i loved it. new girl has a machine gun that pops out of her butt. how embarrassing! you can see why she's so shy about it. something to be said about weaponizing the shame girls are supposed to feel about their own bodies and such. very enjoyable. might force my friends to watch this one with me later.</p>

            <p>perfect blue (1997)</p>
            <img src="/pics/library/perfectblue.png" class="cover">
            <p>this is my second watch but it's my first entry on here because i first watched this before the birth of sabrinparty. this is such a beautifully crafted film. so glad i have this on DVD. being able to hold a work of art i love so much is... a great feeling to have.</p>
            <p>one of the things that stood out to me the most while watching this time was her struggle with trying to figure out who she is, and how that gets stomped on by all the people who are supposed to be protecting her. the repetition of her first line as an actress, "who are you?" over and over again as she tries to navigate this new chapter of her life she isn't necessarily comfortable with. she quits CHAM because she wants to enter the next stage of her life, adulthood, but she doesn't know what that's supposed to be like, she doesn't like it, and no one is helping her navigate it. the line, "who are you?" is only for the show she's in, but the way this movie seamlessly weaves in and out of these filming scene, making it impossible to tell what's acting and what's real, fully contribute to these feelings of confusion? disconnect with reality and oneself. which is like, exactly what mima's going through. i love the way the narrative mimics mima's internal struggles. it's insane. it's gorgeous. these cuts make it hard to tell what's real. and for mima, a lot of things don't seem real from minute 0. her pop idol image isn't the real her, her acting roles weren't real, the rape scene wasn't real, mima's room isn't real, her dead fish weren't real, her existential crisis wasn't real (the plot of the show she's starring in) which makes it so when real shit happens, when she really starts killing people, that doesn't feel real either. in her isolation, she feels not only disconnected from everyone around her, but disconnected from herself. how can she figure out who she is when she doesn't even know if she's real or if she's yesterday? that is, until we are faced with rumi in mima's red dress. rumi held onto mima's career, projected onto her so much she became her (think: mari projecting so much onto komori she 'became' him) that yearning to be someone else, so exist as someone else, that desire for escape and liberation at the same time. so when mima quit CHAM, rumi's reality shattered. rumi too lost her sense of identity, her sense of self, after CHAM. the scene where mima rips off rumi's wig and she wails was. insanely touching. the whole time rumi's painted as a mysterious mastermind villain but in this scene she's completely humanized and truly sad. unlike any sad we've seen in this movie so far. the moment when she's staring at her reflection in the shattered glass... it's when everything in her shattered as well. and it's rumi's complete fractured reality that jolts mima back into hers. it's the first time she feels secure in herself. she no longer asks who she is, she states 'i am <img src="/pics/library/pbnotes.jpg" style="width: 200px; float: right; padding-left: 10px; padding-top: 10px;">who i am' and <i>that's</i> her moment. the first time i watched this movie, i thought the final scene when mima looks in the mirror and says 'i'm the real mima' was an ambiguous ending, made to hint at some residual insanity in her. but honestly, this time i feel like it's more of a conclusion to her self actualization. mima's found herself. she know's she is herself and is secure in it, now that rumi isn't fucking up her sanity anymore. which... she totally was. i do subscribe to the 'rumi was drugging mima' theory i think that's definitely what was going on. but that's not really important in my opinion. i was scribbling all my thoughts as i watched there's some things i'm just too tired to articulate now. or ever. half baked thoughts. not worth explaining... anyways. i enjoyed rewatching one of my favorite movies. its 6am now. goodnight.</p>

AUGH. no maybe it still is. i am shaking my head in disappointment as i type this. this was starting to become like, if 'inside mari' was a shitty british movie. the way it had the body swap but the other body is still intact so it's really just the main character is trans. and it was. that bloke was a messy bisexual trans hot mess. but then they KILLED HIM. they had him dive headfirst in a will they won't they homoerotic slowburn only to then KILL HIM. they killed that clone guy for being too transgender and too sexy and too gay for her own good. life is miserable. i can't believe they actually deleted him. ugh. i enjoyed this movie so much but it broke my heart. i need some real yaoi to recover from this blow.</p>

            <img src="/pics/library/cannibalhookers.png" class="cover">
            <p>now <i>this</i> is what i'd call Hot Garbage! but in a good way. the silliness in the dialogue was so entertaining. it was just the right amount of stupid and funny for my liking. there was so much hairspray in the making of this movie i am certain it is the sole cause of the climate change crisis we are facing today. was it worth it? maybe. i was actually really into the plot. i just had a good time watching these girls succumb to the social pressures of joining the most batshit sorority known to man. these girls are here to have some Fun and kill some Dudes and drink some Blood and i'm here for it! also I LOVED LOBO! LOBO DO GOOD! BE NICE TO LOBO! my favorite tv cannibal. also i think this movie had so much potential to be gay but it wasn't :/</p>
            <p>also also. there was one 3 minute scene towards the end that just. replayed? i think it was taped wrong or something. super charming. i did not skip past it when i realized the scene was repeating. lmfao.</p>

            <p>this had such a strong start. the first 10 or so minutes were actually kinda funny, got a couple of laughs from me. i liked the kill tv bit at first and i thought it was smart. but it started to go in and out where it'd drag on with a monologue about atomic whatevers and stuff and not enough funny jokes to keep me engaged as the movie went on. so i just started to get bored. i did like the soundtrack though. and my favorite characters were the suicidal all-american girl next door barbie-q and her boyfriend kent bendover. they were fun. the movie poster is misleading there was no bingo and not enough hot babes.</p>

                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAhE_M__39E" target="_blank"><img src="/pics/library/ndt.png" class="cover"></a>
                <p>mixed feelings about this one. but i do think it was better than suicide club. i think the main reason why i feel so uneasy about this is that i cannot for the life of me understand any of these characters, truly. like i get it, on the surface. family drama. feeling disconnected from the people you live so closely with can be maddening. nothing feels real. but i still don't feel connected to these characters. nothing they do makes any sense to me. which is a first i think, in my whole life. so it all feels so weird. i didn't really appreciate the pessimistic? note it left on. with the family back together but. pretending to pretend they're happy, which is what led to everything in the first place, which yoko said she wanted to keep forever, and then she left? i was just confused as to why.</p>
                <p>like, i get why noriko ran away from home (she didn't feel like she was seen as an individual, wanted to be independent, wanted to be seen as unique) but i don't get why she developed daddy issues all of a sudden? and got super attached to her first pretend father? her issue with her dad was that she wasn't seen not that she wasn't loved. and i get why yoko followed her sister but i don't get why she left a trail of clues for her dad, only to reject him when he finally finds her? and then beg for everyone to extend the session only to just leave? and i get why broken dam wanted to kill herself but i don't get why ueno went from suicides to family rentals to suicides again? this is just sorta where my head is at.</p>
                <p>one thing i did really love about this movie though was the camerawork i think it carried a lot of the scenes that would have been otherwise painful to get through with the excessive audio-book esque narration. but most of all i really loved the identity play themes with the concept of the new internet. i love the underlying queer themes they give noriko with her sister making the offhanded comment about how she <i>doesn't even like being a woman. she wishes she was a man.</i> and the fact that she feels the most like herself when she's living out her created identity online. the internet gives her the space to explore her identity in ways she couldn't at home. and her anxieties about meeting ueno for the first time in person, where she'd be showing her 'irl' self was such an interesting way to show how it feels to have your identity not be aligned with your body. this was my favorite part of the movie, the most interesting part in my humble opinion. so i did like it. it just also made me feel frustrated. so. pretty okay movie.</p>

                <p>you know how i said i wanted to watch the rest of giuseppe andrews's movies? well.. not sure if that will happen but i did watch another one. and i loved it just as much. i couldn't look away. it's poetic in a way i can't really describe. it sounds like it should be nonsensical but everything makes perfect sense. it's goofy yet genuine. raw, even. says something about poverty, classism, you know. animal rights. deep stuff. the conversation between the cow and the man who takes him back to the slaughterhouse almost made me cry. he just wants to have a good time. also this movie had the most insanely catchy soundtrack i've ever heard. i played the song that goes <i>"I tattooed a picture of tits on my arm I said baby are you afraid of the fucking docks she said I'm only afraid of how my hair looks in the morning"</i> and she said it made her head hurt. which means it was a masterpiece, in case you didn't know that already. my favorite line is: <i><strong>You're dealing with a guy who didn't eat breakfast yet. What the FUCK is up?</i></strong> this guy has been flipping tables and demanding breakfast and coffee since the beginning of the movie and i resonate with him on a spiritual level. i get it. i get him. these characters are so relatable...</p>

                <img src="/pics/library/findingfrancis.png" class="cover">
                <p>nathan for you always seems to bring out a weird mix of emotions that make me feel a little bit more human than i did before... it's weird because i don't like this guy. bill. he's a narcissist. weird with women a lot of the time. wants trump for president. watches fox news. so like i don't like him as a person. but watching this movie still made me super emotional? it's not that i really wanted a happy ending for him, but i dunno... something about helping someone reconnect with someone they knew decades ago... and talking to them and seeing that they're happy after all this time... and stuff. well. i liked the movie. even if i don't like bill. it was so weird. i wanna know what happened with nathan and that escort... that was so weird. ???</p>

                <p>this... this movie was magical. apparently there are more movies directed by this guy. i plan to see them all. i couldn't tell you if there was a real plot to this one. but it was beautiful. baby swiss spoke to me. she is real. she is me. she does speed and stays up for days on end rewatching her favorite movie about a human who befriends an alien. she writes fan letters begging for an autograph and also can't spell her own name. she is perfect. i love her beautiful friendship(?) with her neighbor. the sweetest, tannest man she's ever met. this movie was so strange. i loved it so much. god bless the internet archive.</p>

                <img src="/pics/library/cemeterysisters.png" class="cover">
                <p>i was absolutely loving this movie sooo much up until the last fifteen minutes when they started saying racial slurs and it was just. ugh. big thumbs down. what the hell man. i didn't even want to see the deranged killer sisters get their happy cemetery ending after that. up until that point it was really fun-- the sisters lure single men with money to their homes and stab them a ton and steal their money, which like! ugh. auntie ingrid stole the show she was incredible. my favorite character. her scene where she's just calling everyone on her contact list to set up back to back booty calls was the best moment of the entire movie. "oh auntie ingrid, you're terrible!" "i know, but not in bed" like she deserves several awards. i am auntie ingrid's number one fan.</p>

                <p>i forgot i could also log stuff i've read for school. i put down 'completed sorta' because i read ajax and philoctetes and i don't think i'll read the others anytime soon. so completed for now. i had a blast reading these plays. ajax reminded me so much of kendall roy from succession and naoya zenin from jujutsu kaisen. lots of 'i am the eldest boy!' vibes from this guy. philoctetes made me way more emotional than i expected.. his exchange with neoptolemus was so sweet. except i hated the ending... not a fan of the 'listen to the gods and stick to the status quo' thing but i guess that's the point of these works, generally. maybe i'll read the rest of this over the summer? i do really love these greek plays...</p>

                <p>this was awful. two hours and thirty minutes of misery. i did not enjoy this. my brain felt like it was sizzling the whole time. like it was eggs i was frying. this movie sucks. why did i watch it all. this movie made me hate myself. never watching another bill zebub movie again. the only time i laughed while watching this was during the 10 or so total minutes they were actually talking. some funny jokes. lots of boring science rants while bill awkwardly palms some boobs. otherwise the entire film was naked ladies. like just, two full hours of naked ladies in slo mo with heavy metal in the background. i wouldn't mind a scene or two or even three like this. but the entire movie?! and bill has the audacity to say this isn't porn. it was. and the fact that there's a seven hour version of this!? seven hours of dickshark? i hate everything. this made me feel so braindead i just went to sleep at 6:00pm... for five hours. antfarm dickhole was like a masterpiece compared to this... i miss antfarm dickhole.. bring me back....</p>

                <img src="/pics/library/valerie.png" class="cover">
                <p>this movie was a weird one! i will preface by saying i found it very concerning that the movie had such a sexual narrative around an actual thirteen year-old actress. i don't know anything about the behind the scenes environment.. so i can only hope that actress was actually safe! ugh. but like besides that i did actually love the movie... valerie is a fascinating character! she's living in this world of absurdity and she acknowledges it as Strange and is like "this is a dream, i'm asleep" and proceeds to just experience the weird world she's in soo casually. she's reading a note from her brother that's super urgent like 'i fear for your life!" and she's just like. unfazed. eating berries like in those paintings. and burns it with a magnifying glass. the surrealist moments of the movie are so theatrical it's beautiful. it makes it all seem so dreamy. it made me feel the same way i felt while watching that marching band in paprika. my favorite scene though was when the town tries to burn her at the stake for being a witch and she sticks her tongue out, makes a silly mustache with her hair, turns into a bird and flies away. it's perfect. there's nothing in this world stronger than a tweenage girl laughing in your face as you try to destroy her. i think for as weird as this movie is, she does have a lot of agency in her story. at least, that scene showed that to me. also lots of lesbians in this movie it's pretty great.</p>

                <p>i didn't learn much about competitive pigeon flying really, i had to look up a cool article to get the social/historical context which is fascinating, btw. but i still ended up really enjoying this documentary movie. it honestly just felt like i was hanging out with these super chill guys and listen to them as they talk about how much they love their birds. it was a very soothing watch. i love the guy that names his birds based on their personalities. thug, the bird that bullies everyone, grandson of bill clinton. it's just great. as a pigeon lover i really enjoyed this. i'm not sure if they're actually having seizures in the air, it is a little sad. but i'm choosing to believe those birds are happy...</p>

                <img src="/pics/library/liverleaf.png" class="cover">
                <p>what the fuck? i don't think i've ever had a movie make me go what the FUCK so many times as this? which i feel like is saying a lot if you just click on the movie tab and see what the fuck kinda movies i watch? i just went through the most ever emotional rollercoaster ever? what the hell?</p>
                <p>god okay so. the first 40 minutes were slow. girl gets bullied. i took a break to eat and i come back and shit immediately hits the fan. and i'm loving it. nozaki is killing all her bullies. the one guy she had on her side in school (aiba) really falls for her, he visits her often after she stops coming to school, he promises her dad that he will protect her. and we know he's a little bit insane too because he's totally chill with the fact that she just murdered five classmates. but like that's still in the realm of normal. my absolute favorite scene of the entire movie was when she's going on a walk with her guy friend with the camera. she's in red, he's in black, walking in the snow. and she breaks down in front of him and starts crying, and with all the tension in her body she bites her lip so hard she bleeds, so her lips are a blood red. and it's just so visually intense and compelling and then he kisses her, and his lips are covered in her blood. and i was just like woah. amazing.</p>
                <p>after this point the characters just get more and more balls to the wall batshit insane. the tiny mastermind, rumi, is like a yandere lesbian for the leader(?) of the bullies, taeko. taeko is important i'll come back to her later. rumi escalates these. crimes. and kills nozaki's entire family. she loses it and tries to kill taeko herself too. and this is the point where i was kinda feeling.. not as pleased with this movie? it was just sooo insane so fast and in my head i just kept coming back to the fact that these characters are like, 12? they're graduating middle school in two months. so like. it was just A Lot. a lot of insanity for literally no reason. nozaki is like the most normal character we have so far and she just killed 5 kids. she has a reason to be this way. these guys don't.</p>
                <p>but then i started to slowly come back once nozaki and aiba had their final showdown (after rumi stabs her in the gut), he's now balls to the wall insane (seriously i think there was something in the water supply that made these kids go nuts) he's also a yandere now i guess. they tussle. she shoots an arrow through his camera lens into his skull. she dies.</p>
                <p>but what really fucking got me. was the final scene. where we see taeko again, graduating middle school all by herself. and she's looking at the empty classrooms remembering her <s>friendship</s> crush on nozaki. there are no words spoken in this scene at all. all we see is taeko cutting her hair, looking through their classroom window giggling, her chin on nozaki's shoulder, while the song that she stole from her, during the time she bullied her, is playing in the background that sings the lyrics: I won't lie to myself anymore / ... / The things were echoing in my heart, will keep being there forever. (the rest of the song was also just so explicitly romantic i just forgot to write down the rest i was too busy picking up my jaw from the floor) and you realize. taeko was in love with her. she started bullying her when she felt that she left her for aiba. it was never jealousy over him, but jealousy and hurt and betrayal from her. but not even in the yandere way like rumi and aiba. she was like... normal. still awful, for letting it get as far as it did-- even if she couldn't stop them. she enabled them. but it clicks that it was rumi and her gang of sociopathic tweens that escalated everything to this point. i was just... in awe. that ending scene was beautifully done.</p>
                <p>i felt like i gave too much of a plot summary here but i wanted to outline how much of a whiplash this movie gave me. it was way gorier than i expected it to be too. it was insane. it was intense. it was yuri. it was also yaoi. i still don't know if i would call it good? would i? what did i even watch? what is anything?</p>

                <img src="/pics/library/killerklowns.png" class="cover">
                <p>the title of this movie is a complete plot summary. this movie was actually so fun to watch i sort of want a physical copy for myself... with my new and growing cd/dvd collection. like. pretty incredible watch experience. the opening theme song????? fuck me that was a BANGER. listen to <a href="https://youtu.be/IQeTZKI43rY?si=dCuvqfSXn4MknMwT&t=55" target="_blank">this shit.</a> i was genuinely (pleasantly, might i add) surprised to see very little of the typical bigoted jokes in this movie? (edit: there was one scene where mike was making some bad sexist jokes i almost forgot) no underlying anti-communist propaganda or like weird homophobic AIDS themes that were so prevalent during the 80s? so i was like woah! this is an honest to god movie about killer clowns from outer space. it was so silly. and so funny. and you can tell the creators of the movie, cast and crew, just had so much fun with it. i love that everyone was just wrapped into cotton candy cocoons. my favorite characters were obviously the ice cream guys. they came out on top, i think. everybody in the entire unnamed town was fighting for their lives meanwhile these two guys were fucking a couple of Hot Alien Clowns. sure the acting was bad, the college students(?) looked 35, terrible stunt work, but nothing will make me hate this movie.</p>

                <p>i actually ended up liking this movie way more than i thought i would. i think i've said this about every 70s movie i ever watched. not sure what i subconsciously have against 70s movies... though i will say my favorite parts were the beginning and end. ainu's introduction and tragic background was beautifully done, despite the overall cheesy feel to it? it's an exploitation film, after all. but a really good one. madam chun my beloved! an awful person, batshit insane, a sickening human being, but yet... i love her so. nothing can make me hate her after watching the scene where she was licking the wounds on ainu's back. she means something to me.. i also loved how ainu's last revenge kill, the one she saved for last, her most important and most daunting confrontation was with madam chun. it felt really validating? i guess, i don't know how to fully describe it. despite all the horrors, their relationship mattered. and how it ended, and the fact that it <i>did</i> end, matters too. you know? not in the right brain space for this. just know. good movie.</p>

                <p>this one was mildly disappointing. i still enjoyed it though, the set up made me think it would be a lesbian movie (woman has three boyfriends doesn't feel emotionally fulfilled by any man despite her family and friend's pressures to get her married and she rejects them all for her dog while saying 'no more men! from now on, it'll just be us') but when the dog turned into a guy like 20 minutes in i was very confused. dog by day human by night is funny though. and also still gay tbh.. having to hide her relationship with him.. etc etc. just not the gay i wanted. somebody get this dog some doggy prozac he's been begging for it for the entire movie...</p>

                <img src="/pics/library/paradisemotel.png" class="cover">
                <p>this movie is pretty hard to write about in a way that accurately captures my feelings on this.
                    because it's a strange one. the dialogue is so alien and unnatural but at the same time so
                    weirdly emotionally comforting? this movie is comforting. with all the weird ai generated
                    nonsense going around i want to make a distinction between saying something was made by aliens
                    vs. something made by stupid ai. this movie feels like it was written by aliens. this movie has
                    a soul. it's so beautiful. it's about a woman who flees her abusive husband and goes on a
                    journey West to the paradise motel. which is not a paradise because that place sucks too. but
                    she is a baddie with a knife and no one will hurt her again. the motel manager runs the place
                    with his mom who's voice is text-to-speech. lots of the dialogue is dubbed over at times i
                    think. it's so charming. it's so wonderful. also oh my god the soundtrack to this is actually
                    incredible i need to find it or make the playlist myself. absolute bangers. okay i just went on
                    letterboxd and i'm seeing people the music some of the worst country music you have ever heard.
                    okay well i loved it so do with that as you will. god bless dawna lee heising.</p>

                <p>i have mixed feelings about this one. i think. the first hundred pages were a bore, the
                    main character was giving a sort of pathetic girl vibe that i did not find interesting
                    at all, but i pushed through. it really started picking up when the girlcult frankenstein
                    workshops begun and they started making and slaughtering boybunnies. bunnyboys?
                    misshapen deformed works of art. hollow carcases? whatever. and then the main character
                    made the best boybunny of all.. which was actually just a masculinized version of
                    herself who is allowed to love her best friend in ways she feels she cant. her best
                    friend ava who may or may not be a bird. it's very absurd and i really liked the
                    intensity of this part. it took me a while to finish because i couldn't fully be
                    immersed, perhaps the writing style and i aren't that compatible. but i didn't hate it.
                    i liked it. i just didn't love it.</p>

                <p>this took me a full day to write my entry for this movie. partly because i needed to sit
                    with it but mostly because i had a lot of other work to do.. this movie was so
                    beautiful. i love the faded colors of the greens outside and how naked the inside of
                    their home looks. it gives the entire movie a feeling of uneasiness from the start while
                    at the same time making it all feel like a memory of your own? if that means anything to
                    anyone at all. it’s such good story. man turns his family into a super high controlled
                    group where the kids don’t know about anything that exists outside their home. they do
                    such a good job at writing how these siblings grow up under these strange conditions,
                    like. they all think airplanes are toy planes because they look small when they’re in
                    the air. they have no concept of sexuality whatsoever so they lick each other (on the
                    knee.. or the shoulder.. or the arm) as a new form of currency. (although this movie
                    does have accidental incest so be warned) (i say accidental because these guys have been
                    so brainwashed they don’t know what sex is it is supposed to be) (they don’t even know
                    the concept of a name). the ways in which this man brainwashes them is so absurd. and
                    the ways in which they respond to this conditioning makes perfect sense. my words still
                    aren’t properly conveying what i feel for this movie but just ugh! it’s so strange it’s
                    so fascinating it’s so beautifully told i love would absolutely watch it again.</p>

                <img src=/pics/library/pinkflamingos.png class=cover>
                <p>this is one of those movies that’s just so incredible and amazing, but i don’t think i
                    would ever watch again. as my friend flavia said, the good parts are <i>so</i> good. and
                    the bad parts are <i>so</i> bad. divine is such a cool character. she kills and eats
                    cops. her politics are, and i quote “KILL EVERYONE NOW. CONDONE FIRST DEGREE MURDER.
                    ADVOCATE CANNIBALISM. EAT SHIT.” and she’s incredible. she pisses on rich people lawns
                    she steals she murders rapists she kills and eats policemen. these are all some of her
                    greatest qualities. but then you know. she hangs out with nazis and fucks her biological
                    son. so it’s like what the hell girl!!!!! i thought we had something special. it’s
                    obvious that the movie was really going for like, Edgy Themes in the 70s which accounts
                    for the Actual dead chicken (rip) and the rape scene <s>and the flexing asshole i will
                        never be able to unsee</s> and the nazis she keeps as friends, i just wish they went
                    a different route. you can’t have Divine be this badass cop killing man eater shoplifter
                    rapist killer and then Also have her befriend Nazis and do weird incest stuff.. that’s
                    my biggest frustration with the movie. but like besides that, i honestly thought the
                    movie was hilarious i laughed so hard i cried. it was funny it was weird i’m so glad
                    edie and her egg man had a happy ending and that the human traffickers were shot and
                    killed. satisfying end plot wise i’d say. shrugs.</p>
                <p>what i really valued was at the very end we got a bonus segment of the director John
                    Waters sitting at his desk like “i hope you enjoyed my movie” like i didn’t just watch a
                    man flex his asshole open and closed for however many minutes too long. this John Waters
                    man is fucking insane. the segment was so much fun though he showed us deleted scenes
                    and talked about how even HE didn’t really know what was going on in some of the scenes
                    which was fun. i really needed that. i needed to hear this man Explain Himself. so like,
                    yeah overall i really enjoyed that movie but like what the fuck</p>

                <p>i randomly popped into a discord vc with friends and saw they were playing this game i'd
                    never heard of, so i stuck around to watch the entire playthrough of <a
                        href=https://racheldrawsthis.itch.io/dead-plate target=_blank>dead plate</a>. the
                    art style of the game is super cute, and i'm a big fan of how they play into that in
                    contrast with the scarier aspects of the game. i think one of my first thoughts as i was
                    watching was 'this is kinda like if doki doki literature club and the tv show The Bear
                    had a baby' (it's not really true but i had only been like.. 3 minutes into the game by
                    that point). the story was short and sweet, which is something that i liked and at the
                    same time Didn't like about it. if that makes any sense at all. it's a very cute game,
                    but i wish it had been a little more developed. story wise? i just really fell in love
                    with the homoerotic vaguely cannibalistic tendencies. cause vince is complicated? i want
                    to play the game on my own again to really get a better understanding but i liked how
                    vince Cooks people.. but he doesn't eat them? he's not really a cannibal except for that
                    one time but that was more of a gay thing so.. i dunno. i like the weird distinction.
                    anyways, dead plate is a very fun game and i've been thinking about it for the past 2
                    days before i realized i hadn't logged this game yet. maybe i'll update this word vomit
                    mess when i replay this soon probably.</p>

                <p>finally got around to watching this, and i ended up enjoying it way more than i thought i
                    would. i went into this with low expectations, especially because i've heard about how
                    awful the writer of the show is to the actresses behind the scenes. but the writing
                    itself, was actually pretty good. i thought the show was really well made, they had
                    moneyyy!! at first, my opinion of the show was that it's like riverdale but way less
                    fun. and i think it's sort of true, euphoria takes itself way more seriously, but it
                    pays off. i adore rue's musical scenes that follow her along the different parts of her
                    journey with addiction. and i also love how they play with visualizing intrusive
                    thoughts sometimes, like when rue and jules had nate tied up to a chair and on Fire, or
                    the scene when cal shot himself in the head when his wife was like "dinner's ready" but
                    the camera panned and cal just left his bedroom as if nothing happened (because nothing
                    did happen). i think i described that awfully but whatever you know what i mean. i
                    thought that was cool. my favorites are jules, rue, fez, and lexi has recently climbed
                    her way up to the favorite character list. these guys carry the series. i love the rest
                    of the characters too they just don't make me as emotional as those guys. i think my
                    main beef with the story is that i don't like how they try to "humanize" or attempt to
                    make nate and cal more likeable throughout the show because the way they do it feels...
                    flat? just wrong. i wanted nate to be more likeable to me, but i just don't like him. so
                    maybe that's not even a fault of the writing. i'm just mad i don't like him when i
                    wanted to like him. i just really like villains who i hate but like at the same time,
                    and nate is not that for me. anywho, i will most likely tune in for season 3.</p>

                <img src=/pics/library/monstersinc.png class=cover>
                <p>man this movie was so good as an idea but pixar manages to find a way to fuck it all up
                    in a way that's just so uniquely.. Pixar. i love the idea that this movie is all about
                    re-learning to trust adults after growing up in an abusive household. and on the other
                    side, what it means to parent when you think you're not good enough. just. kids who are
                    traumatized by the adults in their lives can sometimes lash out on all adults, for boo
                    they're all monsters. but she learns to trust some of the monsters like sully.. but
                    especially not the lizard monster who's name i forget. and they have this whole conflict
                    where lizard is desperate to get boo back and control her and exploit her fears for his
                    gain. and sully just wants her to be safe.. the "she's not scared of you anymore" sealed
                    the deal for me. that's when i was like this is about abuse and trying to give kids a
                    better home. and when sully was put on the spot and asked to scare the robot tester kid,
                    which ended up really scaring boo, made me sooo emotional. she was visibly triggered by
                    sully being actually scary and she's going through a lot of conflicting feelings about
                    who to trust anymore right now. and she's like, not even 2, probably. the guilt sully
                    feels for scaring her like that, overwhelmed w feelings of incompetence i'm sure many
                    actually good parents struggle with.. they only scratched the surface on this & dealing
                    with ptsd i'm upset they didn't even try to explore it more genuinely..</p>
                <p>also mike and sully are literally gay. like, seriously. they are written like a straight
                    couple, but it's fun because they swap the gender roles when it's just them vs when it's
                    time for them to parent. it's silly but i liked it. mike is the nagging wife
                    (relationship wise) with all the times he's rambling on and on while sully is
                    preoccupied and mike is frustrated he's not being listened to. and hes charming and
                    flirty and all that. very socialized. way too comfortable talking to sully's mom and the
                    phone and slapping his ass. but when it comes to parenting hes the distant reluctant
                    father who's not down to do any work but will tell bad jokes and step in when it gets
                    really bad. whereas sully is more of the chill guy, laid back, when it's just him and
                    mike. but when he's parenting, he is the primary caretaker and the one doing all the
                    emotional labor.</p>
                <p>so, this movie was fine. it could have been insanely better given the concepts they were
                    playing with. also if they bothered to put in an ounce of effort into the soundtrack and
                    leaned into the jazz they used in the intro they could have given more depth to their
                    evil capitalism underlying theme.. but no! fuck pixar, man..</p>

                <p>inside mari by shūzō oshimi</p>
                <img src=/pics/library/insidemari.png class=cover>
                <p>wah this manga series is unlike anything i've read before, and god was it an emotional
                    experience. what starts off as a freaky friday trope ends up being an insanely
                    vulnerable (? if that's the right word..) take on gender, body dysmorphia, and Identity
                    itself. i absolutely love the way the freaky friday trope felt incomplete as we learn
                    that while komori is in mari's body, mari is not in komori's. komori was still his loser
                    self. and even then! i did not see the big reveal coming. learning about mari's
                    relationship with her awful mother who completely shattered her sense of identity as a
                    child by giving her a new name after her grandmother died. trauma after trauma was
                    probably the first major way mari's sense of identity was fragmented. then we have her
                    romantic feelings for other girls, which she felt like she could never express due to
                    her social status at school and the fabricated identity of mari she upheld in public.
                    she no longer feels attached to fumiko (birth name) or mari (the put-together, popular,
                    “nice” girl at school). so naturally when dealing with all the above pressures, she
                    projects onto komori. the college dropout hermit who, in mari's words, doesn't know how
                    good he has it. to be free of the social expectations she had to conform to, to be able
                    to love girls openly and honestly, to have a solid sense of identity. to be able to
                    confidently say “i am isao komori.” and not have to question which name to use or which
                    gender to perform. conjuring up this scenario in which she is actually komori who woke
                    up in mari's body is such an incredible way to describe how detached she feels from her
                    own body, her own self. and while her identity crisis is so reflective of the trans
                    experience, at least my Own a lot of the time, i don't actually think mari is trans.
                    what i found fascinating about this concept is that she plays with gender during her
                    identity crisis to reconcile with the fact that she likes girls: it is much more
                    socially acceptable for boys to like girls than girls to like girls, which is why i
                    think mari is drawn to komori in this way. so, i think she's actually just a lesbian.
                    but i love that this manga series allowed for her to explore gender in this way, i think
                    it's so valuable for stories to incorporate concepts like this. i think that's all i
                    have to say for now, i hope I didn't miss anything. oh and, one more thing. the
                    illustrations in this series are fucking incredible. it's the first time i've actually
                    noticed the difference intentional paneling makes when telling a story in this format,
                    and god does this author make use out of it. the art style is soft and makes everyone
                    look so human, and the paneling create a sense of pace and dramatic flair that i never
                    thought was possible. i'm honestly in love with this story and will be recommending it
                    to all my cool queer friends until the day i die.</p>

                <p>now <i>this</i> is how you make a movie about real life events. i had read a bunch of
                    articles about this case a while ago, so i knew a lot about this plane crash and what
                    came of it. but this movie told their story in a more beautiful and truthful way than
                    any words printed on paper. my friend flo had some trivia facts she pointed out to me
                    (like when some of the survivors appeared as background characters) which also added to
                    my watch experience. god, this movie was just so well made. it's made me realize one of
                    my favorite thing about a movie (or tv show, tbh) and it's how they play with sound. i
                    don't know how else to explain it, but i just loved the moments of pure silence, which
                    made the softer noises seem explosive. it's something they do a lot in The Bear too,
                    which is what made me love that show so much. anyways. incredible movie. so nice to know
                    that the survivors actually had control over how their story was told, how they gave
                    life to the ones that died in those 72 days, and actually got to participate in it.</p>

                <p>this movie started off kinda bad but only got better and better. the premise of it all
                    seems nearly identical to The Brain That Wouldn't Die, but i should have known better
                    than to have expectations. because at first it's like, alright. society is fatphobic.
                    let elizabeth eat her damn pretzels. but then it's like woah. i kinda like how this
                    movie exposed the value hierarchy placed on women. like how jeffery's first plan of
                    action was to kill a bunch of sex workers (who are de-valued by society) for their body
                    parts to use for his dead girlfriend (who is a virgin and therefore 'pure') who he is
                    Forcing back to life. like, no woman (dead or alive) has any sort of bodily autonomy and
                    the narrative portrays it like the bad thing it is. lots to say about how bodies are
                    used to define people, and how horrifying that can be (hence, jeffery's end, when he got
                    a taste of his own... medicine) lmao. anyways i totally loved this movie. next year's

                <p>i spent the first forty or so minutes of this movie debating if i should turn it off. but
                    then.. but then i started to like it. not sure if it's because it was 5 in the morning
                    and i hadn't yet slept. or whatever. but i unfortunately thought it was really good. my
                    favorite part was when gordy finally made the tv show about the zebras in america. the
                    'my dad was weird back home, but america made him crazy!' line was just too real. gordy
                    is just like me i hate to say it. this movie perfectly captured what it's like to be the
                    eldest son and be constantly at war with your father who's slowly losing his mind due to
                    capitalism and stuff. also his bad spending habits were just too real. i too would
                    stumble upon a million dollars stupidly and lose it all in under twelve hours. sounds
                    legit.</p>

                <p>watched this movie in 2x speed because Multiple Reviews mentioned to do that lmao. it was
                    a good choice. the scenes are sooo long. found it hilarious that our main lady made sure
                    to use a condom.. good for her. anyways this was definitely a movie that i have seen. it
                    was so gross. why was the skeletonized corpse so wet and gooey!!!! why did the guy slurp
                    up the eyeball!!!! just ewwwwww. so many diseases!! are these people not worried about
                    getting sick?! i was cringing from the grossness of it all the while time but the END!!!
                    what an ending. actually incredible. the image of that heel digging the shovel into the
                    freshly buried grave will stay with me forever, i think. also, the music was super good.
                    at least it sounds really good at 2x speed. so, lots of redeeming qualities.</p>

                <p>so extremely stupid. so hilariously enjoyable, sadly. transgenderism (real, not just in
                    my head). some prehistoric orgasms. alligator bimbos. lots of boobs. gay zombies. lots
                    of lasers. this movie pushes the boundaries of cinema. this movie is probably
                    homophobic. but i just watched this movie so i simply do not have the cognitive
                    capabilities to think about this now. it's also camp. would have been a perfect movie if
                    it was shorter. repligator did not need to be 86 minutes long.</p>

                <p>this was the very first moroccan movie i've chosen, sat down, and watched on my own. i
                    don't really count whatever was on the tv growing up because i never paid much attention
                    to those. still crazy it took me this long. this movie seemed really cool because punks!
                    in morocco! woah! except i was tricked. bamboozled. overall the movie was fine. not bad,
                    very average i guess. i just really wished it was more punk. the traitors themselves
                    (name of malika's punk band) were present for like a good give minutes of the whole
                    movie. i do love that we got to see some mountain folk (i love the mountains) and that
                    malika and amal had a sorta gay moment if you're delusional enough..</p>

                <p>i think this movie was made during covid times which makes the experience that much more
                    eerie and fun. i had a blast watching this. idk why i didn't expect this to be a toxic
                    yuri movie but it was, and for that i am eternally thankful. the relationship between
                    charlotte and sarah made no sense. how they went from roommates to the most weirdly
                    toxic couple with an assumed long history in 4 hours is something i will never
                    understand. but i loved the twists. my one crit was that some of the scenes were so long
                    it was painful to watch. the producers of this film were just dying to use their bird
                    and lake footage, i guess. i liked it.</p>

                <p>you know i'll be totally honest.. the main thing that kept me engaged throughout all two
                    and a half hours of this movie was how absolutely stunning the main character is...
                    Kenji Sawada is so pretty and gorgeous in this movie.. it was good though, i didn't hate
                    it. considering how interesting the movie poster is, i thought the movie would be
                    funkier. but it was just regular good. loooove the wardrobe for this movie. made me
                    appreciate 70s fashion way more. i do think our main guy is balls to the wall insane.
                    not because of the whole bomb thing, but because if it were me and i was making an
                    atomic bomb for literally no reason, and had the most beautiful woman in the world flirt
                    with me, i'd drop everything to be with her. but like, whatever man. he threw her into
                    the ocean because he wanted to go home and cuddle with his plutonium! like, come on!
                    smh.. gay people... also the last ten minutes of this movie were actually so ridiculous.
                    why didn't the cop die after being shot fifty million times. why did kido survive the
                    fall off the top of that building by... swinging on a cut telephone line. what. what.

                    weirdly mundane plots ever. it really is just about a bunch of anthropomorphic fruits on
                    a flight to hawaii or something. and then there's volcano gods. but it's just like,
                    whatever. some people died. i think. it's a stunning movie though, and the music is
                    incredible. i think this was a demo of sorts? originally? not sure, and i'm too lazy to

                    19 kids and counting when i was a kid, back when i watched cable tv. and to see how they
                    were living all that time is sickening. the way they described the IBLP <strong>"turning
                        every father into a cult leader"</strong> was just absolutely horrifying... overall
                    i thought the series was really well done and what they have to say is very valuable..

                <p>this movie was absolutely mind boggling. when i finished it the first time i immediately
                    re-watched it again with my friend lola because what the fuck. this movie was so good
                    it's shocking. i am just so amazed at how these women wrote this story and all its
                    surrealism. it's incredible. this movie is about a lot of things but the main themes
                    that stood out to me the most were. what it means to be a woman. and the colonial
                    hellscape that is suburbia. jill the people pleaser is a character that was just soo
                    relatable. the way she bent over backwards to make everyone around her happy, and how
                    the neglect of her own feelings are reinforced by everyone around her (when she's
                    struggling to cope with her son becoming a dog and her husband is like.. can you not
                    make this about yourself?) telling that one lady she named her daughter madison after
                    the neighbor's mother when she literally didn't... she just wanted to make her feel good
                    when jill was the one who needed to be consoled. it's so well done it's a little
                    heartbreaking.</p>
                <p>colonialism as the other underlying theme in this movie was so fascinating.. with the two
                    classroom scenes on the western expansion, the 'i don't mean to be an indian giver',
                    lisa stealing jill's baby, little helen stealing jill's house, playing soccer on a
                    graveyard, the horse skeleton found in her backyard... throughout the entire movie we're
                    given glimpses of the death and the irreversible aftermath of what american colonialism
                    did to indigenous communities. it's like. suburbia is hell because of capitalism &
                    colonialism and this culture of needing to conform and be better than everyone else at
                    the same time. but it's void and empty at its heart because it's built on death and
                    carnage. and it's enough to drive anybody mad. ugh there's just so much to this movie i
                    want to write a more structured Thing about it but i don't think i will. too tired lmao.
                    but like. god this movie was Insanely incredible.</p>
                <p>also that fucking ending?! probably the best ending to a movie i've ever seen in my
                    entire life. jill goes through this entire experience where it feels like she's breaking
                    free from the cycle of hollow absurdity that is her suburban life (something to be said
                    about the 'mating in captivity' book she reads/recommends in the movie) but she
                    ultimately ends up going back to where she came from. but not in the same social
                    position. it's probably the only time i've actually really liked a pessimistic? ending
                    to a story. because at the end of the day, while she went back to this life she tried to
                    leave, it's still a pretty great fuckign life. materially speaking? i don't really know.
                    that's why i love this movie so much.</p>

                <p>this was such a fun movie to watch. i started it on my own and stopped watching 10
                    minutes in because i realized i'd rather watch this with my friend so i did. which was a
                    great choice. i absolutely adored the fact that it was mostly shot in tiny sets where
                    all the buildings and props and cars were literal toys. it had such a fun DIY feel to it
                    which made watching it sooo enjoyable for me. also, i was so shocked by the radical
                    environmentalism in the movie? like yeah, fuck golf courses they're killing the planet
                    and the indigenous people who are kicked out of their homes to build them on. and the
                    one moment where they talked about the pinnacle of communist societies being their
                    reliable public transit and universal free healthcare? i was so very pleasantly
                    surprised. i only wish the eco terrorists got the happy ending they deserved lmfao.</p>

                    love sasaki and the simple relief he gets from his emotional support retail clerk.. it's
                    so relatable. i too have an emotional support retail clerk that makes my day when she
                    recognizes me and says hi. it does a lot for us tired working folk.... lol. anyways. he
                    is very fun, sweet, relatable. and tayama! the coolest girl ever! she's so silly and
                    funny and i really enjoy her antics. i'm excited to see how they navigate their Adult
                    Loneliness i feel like she and sasaki genuinely like each other a lot, so. i need more!!
                    i also need tayama to hurry up and tell sasaki about her Secret.. i can only put up with
                    the hannah montana bit for so long... </p>

                <p>my first ever neil breen film. can't believe i haven't heard of this guy sooner. i
                    literally had no idea what was going on nearly the entire time. not knowing anything
                    made the experience better, i think. could not take my eyes off the screen, despite the
                    many awkward quiet pauses throughout the movie. i am a big fan of the editing over stock
                    videos, the special effects, and the voice over during parts of the dialogue. and i'm
                    not even being sarcastic. i had so much fun watching this movie and i intend on watching
                    the rest of his works soon... </p>

                <p>christ this movie was so bad. i did love it, though. it was funny. watching this 30 year
                    old man fight off his bullies with the ants in his pants was so amusing... love the fact
                    that he lives on Dick St i think that's amazing.. the objectification of women in this
                    movie was crazy but it was also so silly i couldn't even be mad about it? my favorite
                    girl is the news reporter who sunbathed in the woods and talked about terrorists.
                    nothing she said made any sense. besides that, i loved the ant puns. and i appreciate
                    how anti-cop the movie is. overall, it's exactly what i expected from a movie called

                    (the show) is really funny. but also pretty sad. fleabag (the character) and her best
                    friend boo's storyline made me really emotional. i didn't like claire at first but she
                    grew on me pretty fast. i was so proud to see her chase after the man of her dreams in
                    an airport or whatever.. she deserves happiness too. and so does fleabag. i'm not sure

                <p>a very silly and fun little watch. a bunch of teens beat up a refrigerator and the
                    refrigerator fights back. the little meow meow didn't deserve that, though... the fact
                    that this movie was 15 minutes long was literally the perfect choice because in that
                    time, three people and a cat were eaten alive before one of the characters realized she
                    could end it all by unplugging the appliance. and then the movie ended! so realistic. my
                    favorite part was when the fridge started breathing (?) fire before eating one of the
                    roommates. the lesson learned is that you should take good care of your kitchen

                <p>another sino sono film.... this was unintentional. i've seen the 'hey! let's all kill
                    ourselves' gif used as a meme online and i was curious to see what it was from.. only to
                    find out it's made by the same guy who made love exposure, which is what i've been
                    obsessing over all day. well. anyways, i wasn't the biggest fan of this one. i guess i
                    just wasn't as engaged. besides the initial scene at the train station, i wasn't drawn
                    to the story. it was too cop thriller mystery for my taste. i appreciated the early
                    internet culture, though. and i will say the most interesting part of the movie for me
                    was when genesis showed up in his shimmery black suit, his bejeweled belt and platform
                    heels, and his electric guitar. i just thought he was neat. i actually <i>do</i> think
                    it might be worth coming back to this movie later, though. i could reference this movie
                    if i ever want to write about celebrity culture or weird relationships people develop
                    with media. but yeah. it's not bad, just not my cup of tea. but i'd be willing to give
                    it another chance...</p>

                    really get into it. but once i was locked in, i was fully invested. i.. am sort of
                    speechless. the last twenty minutes of this movie made me want to vomit.. insane twist.

                    between the mind/soul and body. lots of opportunities to queer code media like this.. i
                    will also say, the title is misleading! 'wouldn't die' implies this lady <i>wanted</i>
                    to stay alive. the whole time the poor woman was begging to die.. it's her silly husband
                    that kept her severed head alive to give her a new hot bod.. but whatever!</p>

                <img src=/pics/library/loveexposure.png class=cover>
                <p>i had literally no expectations for this movie going in. all i had read was the
                    letterboxd summary and that was convoluted enough to get me interested. we got the porn
                    industry, cross dressing, lesbians, gender identity and expression, kung fu and crime,
                    and catholic guilt. and then you watch the movie and you realize the summary left out
                    daddy issues and cult trauma. for a movie to cover all that. can you guess how long the
                    movie would have to be? four hours. now i know this would probably turn off so many
                    people. but i'm different. [homelander voice] i'm better! the best and only way to watch
                    this would be in one sitting. which is very doable. the movie was Surprisingly really
                    well paced. i was genuinely engaged the whole time and i never felt like the pacing was
                    too slow or too rushed. i could give a summary here, for those of you reading this who
                    are slightly interested but don't have 4 hours to spare. but i won't. that would make
                    this already lengthy entry about three thousand words longer and google is free. i'm
                    just going to talk about the transness and the lesbians. let me preface by saying this
                    was made in 2008! an explicitly trans lesbian movie made in 2008! that's actually good
                    (in general and for 2008)! a huge moment for me was at the very beginning, where yu
                    loses a bet and has to dress up as a girl as “punishment”.. but yu ends up really
                    enjoying it! “i walked like a cool chick,” he says. “i loved to be in drag. it made me
                    feel good.” this happens before he even meets his love interest. why is that important?
                    well. it would be so much easier, but hold way less meaning for the writers to have
                    continued to go with the “dress up as a girl as a Punishment” bit and only have yu rely
                    on the cross dressing as a means to get the girl he wants. but they didn't do that! he
                    loved this new expression of gender all on his own. no motivations or influences or
                    outside factors attached. it was genuine. he even gives this new persona a name. miss
                    scorpion. who he falls back on when he needs to feel safe and strong. yu didn't think he
                    was enough to break yoko out of the cult brainwashing. he felt he could only save her as
                    miss scorpion. not just the woman yoko fell in love with, but as the woman who could
                    beat up the bad guys and the woman who yu felt safe confronting yoko in. if that makes
                    sense. yu and miss scorpion and yoko are so important to me. and this is weaved
                    throughout the entire story, and in a way Confirmed at the end. when yu is in the
                    psychiatric hospital he goes by miss scorpion— when he sort of loses it the person he
                    feels safest and most comfortable as is miss scorpion.. not yu. i think there's meaning
                    to that. it is undeniable that yu is a girl and that he and yoko are lesbians. like, how
                    shapeshifting as a fictional ability is basically used to mean transness, breaking your
                    lover out of psych wards is most definitely supposed to mean lesbianism. if you get it,
                    Great. if you don't, i Will explain if you write me or something. just saying. i
                    honestly doubt anyone reads these except for me but still. i think my only ick with the
                    movie was that they wrote this story as a “young SA victim 'turns' lesbian as a result
                    of her trauma” and the “i thought i was a lesbian, but I was just confused” trope, but
                    in my opinion at least, the genuine transgender character arc and expression in the
                    movie outweighs that. but like, it's still a valid criticism.</p>
                <p>i think the theme of cults and organized religion was really interesting. i loved the way
                    in which all three main characters had different types of religious trauma, and their
                    reactions to it as they were growing up. the obsession with whiteness when it came to
                    yu's dad and the Catholic Church was really interesting too. i'm not sure if the writers
                    intended to comment on western Christianity and white supremacy, because other than the
                    few lines of dialogue between yu and his father, it wasn't really mentioned again. but
                    then again, there were so many religious references that went over my head because im
                    not christian or catholic. what i really loved was that it brought up the hypocrisies of
                    how people practice organized religion and at the same time come back to the idea that
                    the most important thing about any worship is to do it from a place of love. which
                    reminded me a lot of the major themes in the bleeding of the stone by Ibrahim Al-Koni.
                    the moment where yoko recited Corinthians XIII at the beach while Beethoven's 7th
                    Symphony in A Major, Op. 92: II. Allegretto plays in the background was one of my
                    favorite moments in any movie i've ever watched..</p>
                <p>on another note, the cinematography in this movie was insanely beautiful and campy.
                    perhaps i'll add more here but for now. this is my new absolute favorite movie ever..
                    along with frozen 2 and DEBS.</p>

                <p>it was a cute show.... but i did not like it as much as the boys. which is unfortunate
                    because this show <i>should</i> have been just as good or even better... but it was just
                    very average. my biggest disappointment was that none of the characters were insane red
                    flags. they were too normal. their problems were normal their conflicts were normal.
                    nobody was killing anybody for funsies! it just felt like a regular teen show. i'll
                    still #tunein for the rest of the series because i didn't hate it... i was just
                    expecting it to be as intense and campy as the boys... jordan is my favorite they were
                    the main reason i watched the whole thing. i think the reason i feel so shrugs about
                    this is because i made the terrible mistake of watching this Immediately after the boys.

                <p>this was the movie that taught me movies can have style. god i loved this movie so much.
                    i can't believe i hadn't watched it sooner. i think my favorite part of the movie was
                    our lovely narrator. i am obsessed with how skillfully he weaved us through the stories
                    of all these characters and still made sure to keep a sense of cohesion between all of
                    them. never at any point did i feel lost or bored as he was connecting the lives of
                    these people in this movie. the camerawork was also so immersive, and i am a sucker for
                    immersive experiences when it comes to the media i consume. one of my favorite scenes
                    was the one in the beginning where they filmed the years go by as "carrot" (the
                    subtitles translated their names instead of just spelling them out which is... annoying)
                    took over his headquarters. the way so much history was shown in that one room. i have
                    no idea if i worded that right.. there's a lot that i didn't mention because i'm a
                    little sleepy after watching this but wow. if you haven't seen this movie, what are you
                    waiting for??</p>

                <p>holy shit i just watched all three seasons of this in exactly three days. right before
                    the year ends. watching this show was a wild experience. from the exploding people to
                    the weird sex to the bizarre psychological issues with these guys.. i loved it all.</p>
                <p>homelander... oh homelander. he is such a fun character. scared the living hell out of me
                    in the beginning, and still does. just in a very different way now. i appreciate his
                    Brand of fucked up in the head and i really had fun watching him break down over the
                    course of the first three seasons. it's very satisfying to watch a character's mental
                    state unravel slowly like a ball of yarn, and this show portrayed it so well! and the
                    actor too. the way you can see the Pained look in his eyes... and it's like. for what.
                    whyyy. homelander is nuts. i love him.</p>
                <p>i laughed Out Loud when i first saw erik kripke's name in the credits of this show.
                    supernatural follows me everywhere i go. and then i see bobby fuckign singer. and then
                    jensen ackles. it's just too funny. this show was made for me.</p>
                <p>jensen as soldier boy was also soooo fun and exciting to watch. i loved him in this role.
                    it was pretty jarring because the only other thing i've ever seen ackles in was
                    supernatural. so to see my lovely dean winchester, the people's princess, the truest
                    soul and the most Good character... also have the same face as fucking soldier boy the
                    war criminal and enthusiastic brain smasher who smokes weed to cope with his untreated
                    ptsd was a hilarious experience. they wouldn't even let him say fuck in supernatural!
                </p>
                <p>something i wondered a Lot when i was watching this is how it will age in the future.
                    they had soo many news and current events references throughout the whole show (the
                    pepsi BLM commercial, lots of trump stuff, covid discourse references.. etc) i wonder if
                    people who watch this in like twenty years will catch those references? not sure if
                    that's a silly thing to even Wonder... but i still wonder...</p>
                <p>also, props to The Boys for being the only show/thing Ever in my whole life to get me to
                    like a french person. seriously. i couldn't (still can't) stomach listening to the
                    language unless it's coming from frenchie's mouth. now it's fuck the french except for
                    frenchie. him and kimiko were my favorite duo in the whole series. their love moved me,
                    seriously. thinking about them for too long made me so emotional. i really just loved
                    watching the both of them care for each other after all the horrors they've been though
                    both individually and together. i just love seeing love found in the most unlikely of
                    places. i will be tuned into this weird ass show when season 4 comes out...</p>

                <p>i loved this movie! oliver was so fun to watch! from the cum bathtub licking to the dirt
                    fucking to the naked dance party. the guy is just having a blast. i was worried i'd get
                    bored of the movie when i saw it was two hours long (if you or a loved one have been
                    affected by shortened attention spans due to excessive social media usage, you may be
                    entitled to financial compensation), but i literally did not feel the time go by. the
                    pacing was perfect. i loved the visuals in the movie too, the summertime shots, the red
                    curtains cloaking the room in red, the funeral scenes, it was just all so visually
                    appealing to me. i very much enjoyed this movie. very fun indeed.</p>

                <p>i literally never click on whatever crunchyroll's algorithm decides to recommend to me
                    because it's usually bad, but i just. very randomly decided to go with with this new
                    weekly that literally piloted yesterday? and it's safe to say that this was the right
                    move. this is just such a cute little show about a guy who's had a horribly abusive boss
                    and is currently starting at a new job! he's still very traumatized from his old job
                    experience but his new stoic yet very goofy boss is showering him with kindness that
                    momose doesn't really know what to do with. it's just so sweet watching his boss,
                    shirosaki, teach him that it's okay to make mistakes as he creates the healthiest work
                    environment for this new employee! it's so wholesome. i will be tuning into this weekly.
                </p>
                <p>saturdays are my new favorite day of the week. shirosaki making the ad that led momose to
                    gather the courage to switch companies brought me to tears. this is the most wholesome
                    series ever i haven't experienced such a Raw serotonin boost from a tv show in so long..
                    they make me so happy! waaah °˖✧◝(⁰▿⁰)◜✧˖°</p>
                <p><strong>christmas update: </strong>looks like that's a wrap for season one! i really hope
                    they come out with a season 2 soon. this show is so comforting and wholesome i've never
                    seen anything like it. i usually end up hating fluff/wholesome shows like these because
                    they always tend to get extremely boring but this, this is just perfect. idk what
                    they're doing right here but whatever it is, it's working. the characters are all
                    perfect and funny and feel so real. and they're so sweet. this show is literally just
                    therapy for me.</p>

                <p>maaaaaaan. this movie was so beautiful. i really loved it. sad news is i ran out of adhd meds so my thoughts are very muddled so the next couple thought blurbs will be pure rubbish. my bad. i loved this movie soooo much though. visually it was beautiful. chen nian looking at the fish while beishan was looking at her was so beautiful to look at. among other scenes. nian clawing her way to some semblance of happiness with beishan, her shadow, watching out for her made me so emotional.. the duo just mean so much to me. <strong>"you'll protect the world, i'll protect you"</strong> i'd do anything for them. i liked the ending i was really worried this would have a tragic ending with beishan dying (20th century girl trauma lmfao) but seeing him come back again at the end after all the horrors was so nice to see. ugh. plan to rewatch soon despite the movie being two hours long.</p>

                <p>this movie was absolutely hilarious the entire time. i loved how horribly toxic this
                    friend group was, it was a perfect recipe for disaster. there was a good, old-fashioned,
                    honest to goodness doomed toxic yuri dynamic between the two main girls. it was great.
                    there was one 5 min sequence where the "gen z" lingo was getting a little too cringe..
                    stopped feeling natural. as if they last minute had an old man write 1 page of the
                    script and then switched back to the original writer for the rest of the movie. besides
                    that it was great. the ending.. was brilliant, in my humble opinion. of course pete
                    davidson would accidentally kill himself making a tik tok. it was such a funny reveal.

                <p>suuch a beautiful film. i appreciate how it really felt like this movie was done with a
                    lot of thought and care, which is evident. big fan of the eerie camerawork, it really
                    felt like a classic horror movie a lot of the time. the tension was real. what really
                    stood out to me was joe's relationship with his butterflies that gracie wasn't a big fan
                    of.. the thought of him raising butterflies, watching them grow from caterpillars and
                    get their wings, almost like he was wishing he could do that too.. it made me really
                    emotional. and the way he let them go as soon as they were done growing made me think of
                    how he reacted to his son saying he couldn't wait to leave home.. "i think that's good"
                    like he too wants to leave. i just loved how they did that. a tragic story beautifully
                    told, i think..</p>

                <p>lmfao. was debating on adding this here but you know what. whatever yea i watched it. i
                    think <i>for this genre</i> (which i haven't seen much of, nor do i plan to for the time
                    being) it was surprisingly more sensitive than i thought it would be? i appreciated how
                    seriously the movie seemed to take the depictions of re-traumatization when rape victims
                    in particular are pressured or forced to recount their experiences whether it be for the
                    news, for court, for a movie being made, whatever. i think that part was handled
                    surprisingly well, as shown by our very unlikeable and pushy main character. i thought
                    the way they set up the movie to be about the exploitation of sexual assault victims for
                    public consumption While Literally Being an exploitation film itself was really
                    interesting too, i didn't expect this to be so layered in this way. the end did feel off
                    to me though, i get it sort of tried to go a surrealist route but it felt like more of a
                    last minute thought? would have been cooler if those elements were more recurring
                    throughout the entire movie? made the end fall a bit flat. but then again i am
                    overanalyzing a pink film so.. overall i thought it was fine</p>

                <p>belladonna of sadness</p>
                <img src=/pics/library/belladonna.png class=cover>
                <p>i really enjoyed this watch. i didn't know what to expect, as i went into this movie
                    completely blind, but i ended up really liking it. it's unfortunate that Jeanne's entire
                    life and story is dictated by and influenced by the men around her, and the tragedy of
                    it all is that her character and development are spurred on by sexual assault and
                    violence. but what I really liked about the story was the emotional aspect of it all.
                    while i'm usually supportive of the idea that rape scenes are not necessary to tell
                    stories about these themes, the abstract and more artistic depictions of the tragic
                    scenes in belladonna of sadness didn't glamorize or fetishize the assault, which is
                    usually what happens in media. i thought it was more reflective of jeanne's emotional
                    experiences rather than the king's power over her. <a
                        href="https://youtu.be/wrbk7qjPPfk?si=QYCC3dPpfcMrwGYM" target=_blank>this video
                        essay</a> touches on what i mean. also, one of my favorite quotes from the movie:
                </p>
                <blockquote>your soul was screaming. i laughed, i thought i'd never laugh again. the
                    darkness invites and seduces me. spit on by all. i want to become a horrifying woman, i
                    want people to turn away in horror when i pass by in the street, i don't want to forget
                    anger and hatred! <strong>who says anger and hatred are ugly? you are more beautiful
                        than god.</strong></blockquote>
                <p>this just resonated with me a lot. it felt real and genuine and I loved it, and this was
                    my favorite moment of the whole movie. also, the animation and the music were both
                    god-tier. from the couple of reviews i've seen, even the ones who hated the movie
                    couldn't argue against how insanely beautiful the animation and soundtrack is. not even
                    just “for its time” but of all time, and i agree with that. also, found it very funny
                    that Satan was a literal dickhead. i loved it.</p>

                <p>i believe i could do this hibernation thing for a week. i believe it would fix me. real
                    thoughts are i really loved this book a lot. it had no plot really, but it's sort of the
                    point. i took this less as a Story and more as book about a Feeling. kind of felt like,
                    ennui for girls. i think part of why i latched onto this book so hard is that i am
                    currently in a rough place right now (filled with existential dread, stressed out finals
                    season, unsure of what my future looks like, blah blah blah) so i just really resonate
                    with her desire to barely be conscious and fast forward a year of her life. i liked the
                    narrator she's very strange and mean, but very relatable. i was very shocked to see how
                    it ended, i can't believe it actually worked for her. i honestly thought she'd die at
                    the end but i'm glad she didn't. it's very fitting for her fucked up personality that
                    seeing reva die on television was the final lose end she needed to cut to truly live her
                    life, goes to show how much she valued their friendship, lmao. anyways i loved it, but i
                    know it's not for everybody.</p>

                <img src=/pics/library/milkfed.png class=cover>
                <p>what a weird book! i really enjoyed it. i was really hooked in the beginning with the way
                    Broder writes rachel's fucked up thought process, and i liked how despite all her
                    weirdness, she was very relatable. i really loved the way she talked about food, she
                    captured the Obsession aspect of eating disorders in a really fascinating way. i also
                    really valued the way she navigated her relationship with food and with religion. food
                    is usually a central pillar in religion and spirituality, like how the abrahamic trio
                    fast for their special holidays and stuff, so i liked reading rachel's experience
                    navigating her food struggles and her religion struggles at the same time. it was a cool
                    way of intertwining the two.. Spheres. i also really loved the mealtimes with miriam's
                    family even if it ended badly for her, i feel it was rly Good to see rachel have these
                    moments of growth be grounded in food, even indirectly. i enjoyed the way her healing
                    process was written. the biggest thing that sort of turned me off was the way the smut
                    was a little too repetitive? i just felt like i was hearing the same sequence three
                    times over towards the end. but maybe that's just cause i felt weird listening to like..
                    forty minutes of porn in audiobook form. like, i enjoy reading about bad sex (lol) and i
                    really loved that first weird fantasy with ana i thought it said a Lot about rachel and
                    her issues but towards the end it just got meh. but i'm not knocking it down <i>too</i>
                    much because of that because i feel like reading the physical copy might be a different
                    experience. at least, i hope. also while i'm happy for rachel's end as a Character i
                    thought the book itself ended really weirdly.. it was so abrupt! i hadn't realized the
                    book ended i had to re-listen to the last couple chapters to make sure i didn't miss
                    anything! i think conceptually it was really good. appreciated the weirdness aspect.
                    felt like Broder sort of.. got lost along the way. many good moments. more like 3.5
                    stars.</p>

                <img src=/pics/library/twinflames.png class=cover>
                <p>my friend recommended this three episode cult documentary yesterday, and i really enjoyed
                    the watch. i am fascinated by cults in general so this was right up my alley. twin
                    flames universe operates under the guise of helping people find their twin flame, so you
                    can see how easily it would be to deeply emotionally and psychologically fuck with
                    people who are trying to find love. a former member got a hold of his google drive with
                    all the recordings of their meetings to make this documentary. this leader, jeff, is
                    truly evil and i felt insane just watching him talk to these people. he'd fend off any
                    and all resistance to his.. Methods.. by just being like "nobody caressssss" like. he
                    really thinks what he is doing is not that big of a deal.. watching this put me through
                    a Rollercoaster of emotions. i am really glad to see the people involved in this
                    documentary are healing from the horrors they've experienced. the one who touched me the
                    most was Marlee. hearing her talk about what she's doing now that she's out just made me
                    really emotional. i cried seeing everyone taking steps towards healing and the
                    statistics about trans people and trans joy. anyways it was a good watch i think they
                    made this documentary with a lot of care and it was done well. jeff will burn in hell
                    for what he's done.</p>

                <p><strong>tw for rape and gore.</strong> i haven't felt my heart beat as fast while
                    watching a movie in forever. holy smokes was this movie good! visually and thematically,
                    this is one of the coolest movies i've seen all year. i loved the bug imagery they had
                    started us off with, i sort of wished they had followed that thread all the way through
                    but it's whatever, it didn't bother me thaat much that they didn't. like when one of the
                    guys pissed on the spider, i would have had the spider come back again to haunt him.
                    given how spiders are used in a lot of literature/stories to represent resistance to
                    colonial and Other types of oppression. i love jen so much, she is brilliant and
                    incredible. i am so happy she killed them all for what they did, but my one critique
                    would be that i wish the revenge killings were more personal. the first killing i
                    thought was absolutely perfect, he saw her get raped and did nothing, she stabbed both
                    his eyes out. i think the second guy she killed totally should have been castrated and
                    died with his dick in his mouth. that would have been fitting for a) what he did but
                    also b) to come back to his whole thing of feeling emasculated by richard. bonus points
                    for postmortem humiliation. the final chase was really great, i enjoyed seeing richard
                    run around completely naked, disoriented, with his intestines spilling out of him. her
                    disappearing act with the tv blasting and the toy car in the pool that sort of made him
                    feel insane was really great. a very satisfying watch.</p>

                <p>this movie was very disappointing... did not enjoy it as much as i wanted to, as a bad
                    movie enthusiast and monkey appreciator. i was bored for the entire first hour of the
                    movie. honestly, lizzie (the love interest's daughter) and ed carried the movie. they
                    should have been the main characters. they make up for all two stars this movie got. the
                    last half hour was the best, they should have just... made this a 30 minute movie. would
                    have been perfect.</p>

                <img src=/pics/library/lastvamp.png class=cover>
                <p>the vibes of this movie were soooo fun to experience, just overall. an authentic glimpse
                    of 2010. i was a huge fan of the weird filter they put over the entire movie, i could
                    barely see a thing and i loved it. chloe (aka our 'bella') is an anthropology major
                    studying to become a missionary. like what the hell. her church being Against blood
                    transfusions when she has AIDS was a crazy plot development. i really didn't see that
                    coming at all. this movie was so chaotic. even though i don't like chloe, i appreciate
                    her pulling a gun on her dad for trying to burn her vampire boyfriend at the stake like
                    a Witch.</p>
                <p>one thing i will say is that this movie made me think about how much i missed when people
                    just had fun with making movies and tv shows. i sometimes feel like there's this
                    Pressure to only create art that's Good (by what standards?!) or something. i love that
                    these guys just made a full on twilight rip-off and had so much fun with it. it made me
                    really happy. also Loved the music in this movie too. great stuff.</p>

                <p>i thought this movie would be way worse but it was actually pretty good. like a real
                    movie. my favorite character was the wife. when she asked her Mate what he'd do if she
                    died and he said "Ah, my most precious one, I would collapse. I would draw the shades
                    and live in the dark. I would never leave my slar pad. My fluids would coagulate, my
                    cone would shrivel and I would die, miserable and lonely." i knew this was officially a
                    Good movie in my book. she was so happy to hear this. she also thought the bible was a
                    comedy. i love her. i figured this was just a very silly movie about the immigrant
                    parent/first gen experience in america told through coneheads. which was a surprise.</p>
                <p>the song they played at the end credits was so good i looked it up and found out they had

                    was. i had no idea what was going on the entire time. guy put his jacket in the freezer.
                    as if it was a closet. it wasn't. it was a freezer. there was random newscaster

                    movie is supposed to be about a shark-octopus hybrid fighting a whale-wolf hybrid. also
                    it was sad to see so many beautiful queens dying. but alas. hot babes must be eaten by
                    sharktopus for the plot. i did Enjoy a lot of the movie the silliness factor was great
                    the bad acting was great the cgi was great. could have been a blast if it didn't make me
                    so grumpy. i hope the other movies are better.</p>

                <img src=/pics/library/rivermonsters.png class=cover>
                <p>i started watching this because it was my favorite tv show to watch as a child. when i
                    was little i used to keep a journal of every single creature he caught and would do a
                    page profile.. fun facts.. stats.. and stuff like that. i'm really sad i threw away that
                    notebook it would have been fun to look through it now. anyways i really liked that show
                    as a kid and got so excited when i found it on hbo.</p>
                <p>the one thing i found really amusing about this show is how jeremy wade sets up each
                    episode like it's a true crime show where he's hunting the Killer River Monster and
                    spends the entire episode tracking down this creature and stuff and when he finally
                    catches it? he lets it go. it's hilarious..</p>
                <p>however the sad part about rewatching this show now is that every episode i am realizing
                    how racist? this show is. i sort of knew it would be vaguely racist given the whole show
                    is this white guy going into remote south asian and african communities to fish and gawk
                    at their culture... typical anthropologist behaviors and such.. but what made me drop
                    the show completely was when he caught a fish and refused to give it to the community to
                    eat because he cared more for the fish's life than the "starving village" he's been
                    talking about for the entire episode. it was just weird. don't re-watch your favorite
                    childhood tv shows guys...</p>

                <p>i regret being such a hater about this show without having ever watched it. i always used
                    to say i wouldn't like glee because of the singing. because i had assumed the singing
                    would be bad or average like how it is on riverdale. but no. i was so wrong. the singing
                    is incredible i am baffled at how Actually Good this entire cast is. glee is incredible.
                    glee is everything. it's camp. it's hilarious. it's so gay. sue sylvester is my favorite
                    woman. she is funny and cruel and evil and she hates will as much as i do. we're
                    soulmates, in a way. she also reminds me so much of mundane!au kenny it's hilarious.
                    also she got ordained and married herself to herself? i did that in 2018 before i knew
                    what glee even was. that's a kind of spiritual resonance i will never achieve with
                    anyone else ever. i'm on season 3 now... enjoying it a lot so far. i'm watching it as i
                    write this actually.</p>

                <p>now this. is probably one of the best written most beautiful shows i've watched all year.
                    i'm not feeling my best right now so just know whatever i say will not do this series
                    justice you'll just have to watch it for yourself to understand. i love me a show with
                    cute girls wielding guns. like madoka magica! but this is less tragic. still full of
                    angst but with a happy ending can you believe it. real yuri not queerbait. and the girls
                    aren't super weirdly hyper-sexualized! they are given the space to be cute and romantic
                    and check each other out without being weirdly horny about it which is... unheard of for
                    an anime lmfao. it's incredible i am so grateful. and i'm not one of those people who
                    doesn't consider a relationship to be "canon" if they don't come out and outright say
                    they're girlfriends but.. they did that here! they're literally girlfriends! out loud!
                    it's so amazing. girls loving girls with a real plot too i know i haven't mentioned it
                    yet but it's only cause it's an actual complex plot i can't explain in my current state.
                    i'm just tired. the side characters are also beautifully developed for such a short
                    series too! the tomato head guy who's name i forget is wonderful i love him. his sibling
                    dynamic with chisato means so much to me. and the satosugu-esque tragic yaoi side story
                    they had going on with mika and that white guy? incredible. i just love how they said
                    the yaois can be gay and die but yuri will live forever. they're just sooo real for
                    that! anyways i loved this show i will definitely be rewatching this later. my girls ♡

                <img src=/pics/library/fnaf.png class=cover>
                <p>i'm not going to lie i was drawing while this movie on so i was only half paying
                    attention to what was going on <i>but</i> i enjoyed this so much i don't think it's
                    necessarily a bad thing... i very much enjoyed the use of jumpscares they made me feel
                    nostalgic in a way. back when i was 12 and nearly pissing myself over slenderman and
                    Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark... and that one youtube video that's like a car
                    commercial but it's a scary mutilated lady with no eyes jumpcare. my mother showed me
                    that video cause she thought it would be funny. then she put on shakira's whenever
                    whenever music video to make up for it. i'm not sure why she thought that would work.
                    anyways. i loved that they cast peeta from hunger games. i love that guy. he was great.
                    the movie was very enjoyable. idk anything about fnaf lore but it didn't seem to matter
                    much to me while watching. i will probably watch this movie again with a friend so i
                    actually pay attention the whole time but. overall very fun. good vibes. silly.</p>

                <p>my coworker buddy recommended this show for me to watch as i data entry away and to be
                    honest. i didn't think i'd like it that much. it felt like succession but bad. however.
                    i was wrong. i am so invested! comparing it to succession never made sense they're very
                    different shows. i like suits a lot. the characters are very likeable. my favorites so
                    far are donna (icon), harvey (the gojo satoru of pearson LLC), and louis litt (my
                    favorite little rat man). this is technically a critique(?) but i find it amusing that
                    these actors seem to have so little chemistry with each other that every romantic
                    subplot feels like i'm watching robots pretending to be sims flirt with each other. oooh
                    schlorba! (<strong>10-15 edit:</strong> i've now realized this really only applies to
                    megan markle.. i'm sorry she is So gorgeous and a great person like in general... i
                    guess. but acting is just sooo not her special skill..... i also just can't stand her
                    character) except for donna, she's a star. anyways i find it amusing. nothing can
                    convince me mike and rachel actually like each other.. i might have to stop watching it
                    at work though, because i'm too into this show and it's distracting... one season down.
                    eight more to go?</p>
                <p>this show has officially entered the brainrot stage.. donna and harvey have quite
                    literally put me in the trenches. i'm feeling stsg.. dare i say nanageto level chest
                    pains right now over them. they are the only ones who understand real love. i am feeling
                    so emotional over these two..... they are so special to me. the real stars of the show.
                </p>
                <p>now that i've finished all 8 seasons i can say that was such an entertaining show!! i
                    loved obsessing over it for the past... week. i really sped through this. the one time i
                    felt disappointed was when they got mike out of jail and harvey offered him to work
                    there as a consultant this time so it's legal and i was just like. what the hell! if
                    this was an option why didn't they just do this the first time. what was the point of
                    any of it. but i got over it. i'm going to be honest when i say i truly did not care all
                    that much for mike and rachel. i just didn't think rachel was a likeable character at
                    all, and started to get really sick of her when the only time she'd appear on screen was
                    to wail and cry about the fact that she loves mike! so much! like. i get it. it just
                    didn't seem like her character had much to offer. and because she was always with mike i
                    just stopped being interested in him after he got out of prison. which makes it really
                    amusing for me that the writers just cast them aside for the last season and focused on
                    who i was really watching this for, donna and harvey. i have weird feelings about the
                    completeness of the ending i guess, but i just am glad that harvey got the happy ending
                    he deserved.</p>

                <img src=/pics/library/noragami.png class=cover>
                <p>i feel like this entry deserves a lot more brainpower than i am able to give it right
                    now, but i don't want to leave it out so i'll just have to half-ass this for now.
                    noragami is honestly, probably my favorite anime of all time. i've never seen a story be
                    treated with so much love and care. i especially love how all the character dynamics are
                    written, each and every character is just filled with so much love. for each other, as
                    characters themselves. it makes me very emotional. highlights of Peak Emotion from me
                    were: the development of kazuma and veena's relationship & surprisingly, ebisu's story.
                    i don't think there's anything in this world that can make me feel the way kazuma and
                    veena feel about each other. they are my favorite display of love, ever. and i was
                    surprised about how much i connected to ebisu's character. i usually don't like his
                    type, but again-- the way he was written with so much love leaves me no choice but to
                    love him! his reincarnation concept was fascinating and done so well. my favorite thing
                    about noragami is that it shows us how powerful and important love can be, outside of a
                    romantic sense of it. love is always understood as mostly romantic, but the love we see
                    in noragami is both that and not, all of it and so much more. i'm going to be reading
                    the manga soon and i am excited for the real brainrot to seep in.</p>

                <img src=/pics/library/kaiji.png class=cover>
                <p>i started reading this series cause mizu recommended it to me and because i was very
                    intrigued by the art style. it's such a fun series i am so glad i discovered this silly
                    gem. i am fond of kaiji and his pathetic man nature, and i really enjoy the intensity of
                    the games- it reminds me of squid games, i wonder if the show got some of their inspo
                    from this series. probably not but... maybe. i find it funny that it took four volumes
                    for kaiji to get through this crazy game of rock paper scissors, only to not win. that's
                    my guy! i don't think this series will actually go there, but i hope these experiences
                    have kaiji lead to the conclusion that the solution to all his problems would be
                    communist revolution. he's honestly like, halfway there already. around volume 6 he
                    started talking about wealth distribution so i was like... i see you kaiji.. the dots
                    are connecting. although i really don't think that will happen. this is more of a silly
                    marxist comparative analysis take. anyways, i really enjoy this series. kaiji is fun.

                <p>do you ever read a book that changes you so drastically you can't pick up another book
                    for few weeks? that's what happened to me after reading the secret history. i did not
                    consume this book, the book consumed me. once i started i could not put it down! diving
                    into this pretentious academic old school environment made me realize how much i love
                    school, in a weird way. i guess i just really wish i had a tight-knit group of School
                    Mates and i got to experience a piece of that through this story, despite how terribly
                    things ended up for them... i was absolutely enamoured by henry winter since the very
                    beginning (thank you to richard, our wonderfully fruity unreliable narrator!) and my
                    love for him only grew once we got to see how insane this lad is. i was really charmed
                    by his seemingly stoic and uptight demeanor at first while also at the same time
                    learning that he is Very superstitious, and that he monologues about hypothetical plans
                    to take over the school! i know i worded that terribly but for someone who was initially
                    introduced as this super logical and cold guy, i really enjoyed seeing him be silly. and
                    murderous. his cult leader vibes enchanted me. i am not immune. the prose was so fun and
                    packed with ancient greek references i do not understand (yet) so i am glad that this is
                    a re-readable book. i'm seriously looking at some classics classes for next semester
                    because of how much this story impacted me... just. so good. need to find more books
                    like this...</p>

                <p>boy parts by eliza clark</p>
                <img src=/pics/library/boyparts.png class=cover>
                <p>this is for sure one of my favorite books i've read all year. such an addicting
                    page-turner, i got through almost all of it in one day. irina is my favorite female lead
                    main character. deeply flawed, mean, completely and utterly unreliable, yet also...
                    horrifyingly relatable. and funny! i can't even bring myself to hate her. reading as she
                    goes through the motions of repeating the cycles of violence in her own fucked up way
                    was really enjoyable. i'm not sure how to explain it just yet, but the way clark writes
                    makes me feel like i'm in her head. despite doing awful terrible things, it was really
                    fun to see her desperate desire to feel real, through her breakdown. to be taken
                    seriously. <i><strong>Do I have to smash a glass over the head of every single man I
                            come into contact with, just so I leave a fucking mark?</strong></i></p>
                <p>and good God did i not see that big reveal coming. i'm not sure i want to fully spoil the
                    Reveal, but i will say. my jaw was on the floor when irina (re?)discovers the old
                    polaroid pictures with all the boy parts. this moment had so many striking similarities
                    to how the big reveal in OMORI was done, so i appreciated this in so many different
                    ways. ever since reading minor detail by adania shibli, i've been a huge fan of gothic
                    elements in stories like these. the inability to tell what's real from what's imagined
                    in irina's mind was so fun to read, and even better when i go back to reread, which i
                    already plan to do very soon. i feel like now that i know the full story, rereading will
                    let me notice so many more times where irina's sense of reality was destabilized. i am
                    very excited to reread this beautiful work. very dark but very good.</p>

                <p>i almost forgot to log this book on here, i guess you can tell it didn't really Leave A
                    Mark. so i'll keep this short? no point in trying to pull a bunch of words outta my ass
                    for this. the book was fine, i got through it pretty fast. the story was somewhat
                    interesting? i do think it was really cool that i got an advanced copy for free though
                    (thanks arab lit mag!). my favorite part was when dawoud's interview with the evil white
                    man turned into a 1001 nights trope. but i just didn't personally connect with a story
                    or the characters all that much. for most of the time i spent reading the book, i just
                    kept thinking about how <u>season of migration to the north</u> was better. but like...
                    i didn't hate it.</p>

                <p>i was so excited to see where this sequel to go and i was so disappointed! this movie
                    sucked! they took everything that was good and cool and charming about the first one and
                    just..... fully ignored it. didn't use what made the last movie so good. it didn't feel
                    like as much of a body horror film as the first one did? it felt like a regular horror
                    movie. the horror felt less personal, in a way. i felt no connection to martin, at all.
                    which is really the only person i could have possibly feel connected to given how
                    awfully written every other character in this movie was. and the gore wasn't even that
                    interesting. it wasn't... horrifying! like i'd expected it to be. thumbs down from me on
                    this one.</p>

                <p>after seeing some clips on my twitter feed, i sort of knew i would really like this
                    movie. it felt like the perfect mixture of campy high school silliness that would appeal
                    to me. and i ended up loving it so much more than i expected! the cast is hilarious,
                    i've seen clips of ayo edebiri and rachel sennott being besties off set and it was so
                    fun to see them as best friends in the movie as well. you could tell. their friendship
                    is really cute. i laughed so much during the movie i cried a little bit (i'm a crying
                    laugher? laughing crier? whatever). every time someone would mention making a bomb i
                    thought it was just a gag, but they actually did it. every time. it was great. the last
                    thing i expected were for people to die in this movie. brilliant twist. honestly, a
                    perfect movie. more or less. i plan to see this movie in theaters again and also own it
                    in DVD. i hope the physical copy comes with a blooper reel. i know the blooper reel must
                    be so funny.</p>

                <p>what a fantastic movie! wowie! i really had fun watching this. i didn't expect early
                    stage brundlefly to be so funny about turning into a bug. he was absolutely hilarious
                    despite also being so miserable about it all.. it's quite heartbreaking if you think
                    about it, actually. my favorite line was when he said <strong>"i am an insect, who
                        dreamed he was a man and loved it. but now the dream is over, and the insect is
                        awake."</strong> lots of queer gender thoughts to be had about this movie. the movie
                    strangely does a great job at articulating how it can feel to hate the way your body is
                    developing. it's interesting to watch Brundle struggle with living in a body he doesn't
                    want. the guy kept his penis in a jar in his medicine cabinet for... historical
                    purposes. for christ's sake! i would have really liked to see Brundle rub his hands
                    together like a fly, though. i also thought brundlefly's final evolution was strangely
                    cute. i would have kept him as a pet if it were up to me. it's the eyes! they made him
                    adorable...</p>

                <img src=/pics/library/littlenightmares.png class=cover>
                <p>i went into this game completely blind, so i really didn't know what to expect. i had
                    such a fun time exploring the environments, i really loved how cartoonishly tall all the
                    furniture and rooms are in the house areas, and how my character has to move stuff
                    around to reach high doorknobs and things like that. it had a really child-like
                    perspective to it but that didn't take away from the eeriness of the experience, either.
                    i hope that makes sense, the feeling is hard to describe. i am a huge fan of the
                    grotesque monsters we meet in this game, especially the janitor guy with the wicked long
                    arms and the twin chefs! i found them so adorable i really wish they had plushies out of
                    these guys that i could buy.. i am surprised at how short the game is, i finished it in
                    around four hours. i might try to go back later and see if i missed anything, but it
                    seemed to me that it's just a short game. i also wish there was more of a story, but
                    that's just because i <i>love</i> stories. i plan on playing the second game soon,
                    though. i can't wait to see where this series takes me.</p>

                    to make up for this sorry entry...</p>
                <p>august update: i'm coming back to this entry after watching gojo's past arc animated in
                    season 2. i think the animators did a beautiful job. it was so refreshing to see gojo
                    and geto's childhood memories in such bright colors. gojo really remembered his youth
                    fondly. it's really telling given his belief that youth should never be taken away from
                    children... despite reading and rereading this arc in the manga so many times, watching
                    it felt like an entirely new experience. the music was funky but really good. i thought
                    it was really intentionally composed. the detail i'm currently latching onto is the
                    scene where nanami throws a stool across the room when he gets news of haibara's death.
                    it was so jarring to see teen nanami, who seems so composed, display such raw emotion.
                    it was so heartbreaking to see nanami's own anger with jujutsu society, when he mentions
                    the mission wasn't meant for a sorcerer at his level.. they were only kids, after all..
                    this scene always reminds me of the tidbit we got from the official fan-book, where it
                    says that nanami doesn't blame geto for becoming a curse user. nanami was angry too.
                    it's why he left.</p>
                <p>this story is so tragic. in the most beautiful way. i love being reminded of words and
                    memories of the past as the story develops. like how yorozu's words seem to live on and
                    get repeated during gojo's fight with sukuna. like how gojo's present day morals and
                    goals are exactly what geto's were when they first met, as kids. gege seems to like
                    doing this too, so i'm glad we're on the same page. watching the anime made me very
                    emotional about this again. i can't wait to see where this story goes after this...</p>
                <p>march entry: i used to be so normal about jjk since i first started watching the anime
                    last year. but with the way this story has been developing i've gotten so obsessed with
                    it? it's like a delayed reaction almost.. shibuya arc was absolutely devastating
                    (<strong>#shibuyasurvivor</strong>), i read the whole thing in two days with my hand
                    clutching my chest the whole time... can't think about it for too long or else i'll get
                    nauseous. now i am caught up on the culling game arc where my biggest issue is getting
                    attached to characters (higuruma.. kirara, hikari, <a target=_blank style=background-color:#9b6ba9
                        href="https://twitter.com/hiraethiaa/status/1632442622445867012?s=20">kaori &
                        jin</a>, and now yorozu... my darlings) who either will never show up again or die a
                    horrible brutal devastating tragic death... gege is a wicked man... worst of all is that
                    my Favorite character in the entire series is kenjaku. who is sure to meet his demise
                    sooner or later... pray 4 me and all the #kennyfansinternational... i wish gege would
                    let my babies be happy..... meguyujibara NEED a happy ending or else... or else..... or
                    else!!!! [explodes]!!!!!

                <p>i went into this movie having no idea what to expect. at first i really hated the love
                    triangle trope because seeing their dynamic together made me want them all to be best
                    friends. they were all really cute with each other. but i eventually got over it. i'm
                    giving this a high rating because this movie did such a good job at... appealing to
                    Emotions. i don't really know a better way to describe it, so forgive me. but the end of
                    this movie had me sobbing like a baby, which i really was not expecting. that final
                    scene at the end where we see the videotapes our main guy recorded of his time in korea
                    pushed me over the edge. i hadn't cried like that in so long. i think that scene alone
                    was so good it Made the movie for me. besides that, i was a little disappointed about
                    how they handled the love interest death. we don't even know how he died! so, i would
                    have rated this movie lower if it wasn't that final scene. it was just so perfect and
                    Raw it boosted the movie so much for me. still glad i watched it.</p>

                <p>the scum villain's self-saving system (1) by mo xiang tong xiu</p>
                <img src=/pics/library/scumvillain1.png class=cover>
                <p>i brought this with me on my trip to morocco as my Official Summer Read but i didn't have
                    much time to read while i was over there. overall i'd say this book was Alright. the
                    writing felt cheesy at times and for a while in the middle i was starting to get bored
                    of it. however, i do really like how this volume ended, so i'm not fully giving up hope.
                    i really want to see how luo binghe's development diverges from his "fate" and all... i
                    have a feeling it will get better from here. i plan on reading something else before
                    picking up the second volume of this series, though. so, not too bad. but not too good
                    either.</p>

                <p>the handmaiden (extended version)</p>
                <img src=/pics/library/handmaiden.png class=cover>
                <p>knowing how to start this entry is so hard because WOW. i really loved the handmaiden. i
                    watched the extended version without realizing it and i think that was the best decision
                    i've ever made because i truly lost myself in this movie, if that makes any sense. from
                    the beginning i fell in love with the cool cinematography. i loved how they knew exactly
                    when to linger on a specific shot. it made me feel like i was living those moments too.
                    the viewer almost seemed like a curious onlooker for a lot of it, which i thought was
                    cool. one moment in particular that stood out to me so much was when sookee, hideko, and
                    the fujiwara imposter were running off so hideko and fujiwara could get married, and on
                    the way they showed hideko eating one grain of rice at a time. followed by them walking
                    up the steps to the designated place and hideko is behind them all, climbing one step at
                    a time. i read that as hideko wanting to postpone or stall this marriage as much as
                    possible as a Show of how much she did not want to marry this man. i just thought
                    portraying those feelings in that way was so beautiful. one of the coolest moments in
                    the movie, in my opinion.</p>
                <p>speaking of the fujiwara imposter, my feelings for him dramatically flip flopped after
                    the plot twist where we learn that him and hideko had actually established a business-y
                    relationship/agreement between themselves. i loved that he had no power in any of the
                    relationships he was in, and i will never forget his Final Scene. i still think he's a
                    shitty guy, but i will always be amused by him asking for cigs mid-torture session and
                    smoking mercury to get out of his sticky situation.</p>
                <p>i loved the switching back and forth between korean and japanese, and i think it says a
                    lot about language as a form of intimacy. specifically in regards to how hideko and
                    sookee communicated with each other versus how they each spoke to other people. it was
                    beautifully reflective of not only class but also relationship dynamics too. i wish i
                    had learned more about japanese korean history before watching this (beyond surface
                    level information), i would have liked to see how that was incorporated into the film
                    (as i'm sure it was, it just would have went over my head)... </p>
                <p>my only ick was that the last sex scene felt like it was written by a man who has never
                    spoken to a lesbian in real life. the other ones were great, though. but this wasn't
                    worth taking a star off. the scissoring was just, like, whatever.</p>
                <p>overall i am so happy with this movie and the way the story was told. i seriously didn't
                    think my girls would have a happy ending! but they did! too many years of consuming
                    toxic doomed yaoi had dimmed my hope for happy endings. but yuri always saves the day.
                    god bless.</p>

                <img src=/pics/library/badlands.png class=cover>
                <p>okay so i gave this movie a pretty low rating for a couple very unimportant reasons.
                    maybe i just wasn't in the mood to watch this movie because i was really bored for most
                    of it... i also was not a fan of the wolfwood and vash interactions... the way their
                    dynamic was written was not very appealing to me. vash was wayyy too horny brained and
                    wolfwood was just all alone again? when in every other iteration of trigun wolfwood is
                    terribly losing the idgaf war and is always finding a way to be around vash. it just
                    felt very out of character. also was not a fan of the fact that wolfwood looked so pale.
                    who is preventing him from seeing the sun!! let him out!! it's not like i Actively
                    dislike this movie, but it's not something i really care for.</p>

                <p>i started the first two episodes of hello, my twenties! on the plane and i'm hooked!
                    thank you to my friend carlea for this recommendation. so far the show is sooo cute. ye
                    eun was not a favorite of mine at first, but she is starting to slowly grow on me. i
                    adore the rest of the girls so much. if i had to pick, i'd say ji won is my number one
                    favorite character. she is so fun and lively and funny and i will never understand why
                    it's so hard for her to get a boyfriend.. she's perfect! my favorite moment so far was
                    her teaching eun jae how to let loose and dance. she's just such a great person. i
                    understand why eun jae idolizes her so much...</p>

                <p>i'm now all caught up on the summer hikaru died and i am a <i>huge</i> fan of it already!
                    the first chapter hooked me. i really love the body horror aspect of the story. as well
                    as the psychological horror! the intimacy of holding your loved one's organs in your
                    hand is something i can really appreciate..</p>
                <p>hikaru and yoshiki also remind me so much of kenjaku and jin from jjk... (i've got
                    terminal 'make everything about jjk disease' my bad). but it's really not my fault. they
                    call 'hikaru' <i>lord brain snatcher</i>... like come on! i seem to have a pattern of
                    getting really attached to this trope of "i know it's not you but i'd rather have you
                    like this than not have you at all" and i'm not mad about it. i'm really excited for the
                    english volumes to be released, this is absolutely something i want physical copies of
                    in my bookshelf ＼(≧▽≦)／</p>

                <p>trigun (1998)</p>
                <img src=/pics/library/trigun98.png class=cover>
                <p>i literally just started this but i already have a couple thoughts. firstly, i just read
                    that the first episode released on my birthday. in 1998, though, before i was born. but
                    still! i think vash is so fucking hilarious. the dialogue is really funny, and vash's
                    voice actor is incredible! it's so cool they got the same guy to voice him in the 1998
                    and the 2023 version. it's so nice to see meryl and millie be animated. god i love them
                    so much!</p>
                <p>i think episode 23 was the most batshit insane sequence of events i've ever experienced.
                    they can't expect me to take "will you eat these sandwiches.. with me?" as a serious
                    thing. i can't believe they actually fucked. millie is so unserious.. i think it's
                    really funny that wolfwood stayed up til the sun rose chainsmoking afterwards i wonder
                    what he was thinking about (gay thoughts)</p>
                <p>things i like about this version:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Millie Thompson</li>
                    <li>Vash being really silly and funny</li>
                    <li>Wolfwood's top tier sleaziness and sliminess</li>
                    <li>Vash and Knives having long hair as kids</li>
                    <li>guitar music</li>
                </ul>
                <p>things i did not like about this version:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Meryl is a lot dumber</li>
                    <li>Monev should not have had read speaking lines</li>
                    <li>Meryl should never be mean to Millie!!</li>
                </ul>
                <p>highlight of the last episode was the flashback of vash nearly crushing knives' head in
                    with a rock. how cain and abel of them. knives would have enjoyed the thought that went
                    into this.</p>
                <p>overall i think it was Fine. in my head it exists as a nice little silly adaptation of
                    trigun but i wouldn't say its Good. that sounds mean though. i did still enjoy watching
                    this a lot..</p>

                <p>after seeing mizu's posts about slam dunk i've decided to finally start it. i've been
                    really sick the past few days so i figured Now is best time to start it. i really miss
                    older anime actually giving characters lips. i wonder why they don't do that anymore.. i
                    really love our main guy but i wish he'd stop calling the only Black character a
                    gorilla... i know this is 1993 but still..... Not Cool, Man.</p>
                <p>i do love how hanamichi's first introduction is him getting rejected for the 50th time!
                    with his friends celebrating for him. always have each other's backs when they need it
                    most. a good group of guys. hanamichi just joined the basketball team so i'm excited how
                    things turn out for him!</p>

                <p>i watched the first babysitter movie several years ago and thought it was really fun. i
                    had no idea there was a sequel until i found it while netflix browsing yesterday. this
                    movie was pretty fun, i did Enjoy watching it. even though the acting was really bad.
                    and the main character was like a jughead jones but less funny. i absolutely loved jenna
                    ortega's performance in this though, she does so well in campy horror movies. i also
                    think that "sex scene" where they had a bunch of... flower blooming videos and dancing
                    while Jump On It by Sugarhill Gang Apache was playing in the background was. Absolutely
                    incredible. Favorite sex scene I've ever watched in a movie. which is probably a strange
                    thing to say, but it's true.</p>

                <p>trigun maximum by Yasuhiro Nightow</p>
                <a href="https://myanimelist.net/manga/703/Trigun?q=trigun&cat=manga" target=_blank
                    style=background-color:transparent><img src=/pics/library/trimax.png class=cover></a>
                <p>i downloaded over twelve hours of television to keep me entertained on my six hour
                    flight. instead i read three volumes of trimax and knocked out. enjoy my silly little
                    blurbs as i read each volume throughout the summer.</p>
                <p><strong>trimax #1:</strong> I wonder how many times Vash will accidentally destroy half a
                    planet and ghost everyone for a few years. I loved seeing Old Man Vash in this trying to
                    live the simple life. Very enjoyable vashwood interactions in this. They're both just
                    sooo weird they were made for each other. Wolfwood is feeling very girlcrush right now.
                    Okay I think we just landed in New York I have no more thoughts.</p>
                <p><strong>trimax #2:</strong> For someone who calls himself a priest and the devil in the
                    same breath, Wolfwood sure does have a way of acting real omnipresent the way he's
                    always around when Vash is in trouble (though his help is rarely ever actually needed
                    lmfao). I've never seen anyone lose the idgaf war (chainsmoking while replaying the
                    memory of vash calling him a coward over and over again in the middle of the night) so
                    badly and that's <i>a lot</i> coming from me. The reference to their first conversation
                    about Vash's genuine smile and Wolfwood trying to make himself a bigger demon than he
                    actually is “while his own heart cries out” was really good. I had to pause. I think my
                    favorite part of their dynamic is how they just see right through each other! For the
                    most part. From the moment they laid eyes on each other. I think that's pretty neat.
                    Leonof is definitely the most fucked up of the Gung-ho-gun gang.. the puppets of Vash's
                    family falling apart in his hands is just so cruel.. I love the themes of Family in this
                    series. Vash and the family he dedicates his life to honoring, Wolfwood and his kids he
                    kills to be there for (nico niiiiii), Millie and her monthly newsletter to every single
                    one of her extended family members, Knives dedicating his entire life to getting Vash to
                    be by his side. It's all just so good. No real thoughts just Good.</p>
                <p><strong>trimax #3:</strong> I think it's interesting how the main point of contention
                    between Wolfwood and Vash right now is whether or not it is inevitable to kill. And I
                    think I'm starting to understand both of them and the Issue at large here. I think what
                    pisses Wolfwood off so much— how Vash seems to recklessly sacrifices himself every
                    fight— is that he seems to be able to do this from a point of privilege (I don't think
                    this, I think this is what Wolfwood thinks). I'm starting to see that more with the
                    repetition of WW's inner monologue questioning if Vash is Human or Monster. I think the
                    fact that Vash has the abilities to make it through these situations in which he
                    definitely should have died, can be read in one way as he can afford to risk more.
                    Because he knows he'll make it out alive. And Wolfwood is frustrated with his seemingly
                    lack of self-preservation. This might be stupid but that's sorta what I'm getting from
                    his whole "do you not even care what happens to you" vibe. I'm okay with being wrong
                    about this. Also, I like how Wolfwood hasn't realized yet that Vash has no regard for
                    his own well-being. So he's always shaking his fists like Vash whyyy do you do this to
                    yourself and he's like. ☆⌒ヽ(*'､^*)chu I Deserve This. Yeaaaah these guys have got some
                    real issues i love them so much.</p>
                <p><strong>trimax #4:</strong> wolfwood has gotten more time to shine this volume and i'm
                    loving it. I really enjoyed watching him beat Nine Lives to death. I was wondering when
                    they'd let him do that after all his monologuing about the necessity of murder and
                    killing to survive and blah blah blah. Loved that! And the hospital scenes!! These were
                    my friend's favorite chapters and I can totally see why. They're mine too so far.
                    Wolfwood is finally starting to Conscioulsly (as opposed to subconsciously) understand
                    Vash and why he does what he does. He's so attached it's really fun. Vash loves him a
                    lot clearly, and Wolfwood is just always around and pretending to not enjoy it like “you
                    need me so bad it's embarrassing” (he's projecting). I'm really excited to see more of
                    Knives and his evil plan to uhhhh convince Vash that he was right all along? I love
                    Knives so much he's so silly and so amusing I love every panel that he's in and I hope
                    she shows up more in the next volume. I would love to see more interactions between him
                    and Vash and maybe even Wolfwood too..</p>
                <p><strong>trimax #5:</strong> Knives will always be such a funny villain because he
                    genuinely thinks Traumatizing Vash even more will surely work in his favor. If his main
                    goal is for him and his brother to work together and be One Team, you'd think he'd be
                    more open to compromise... or at least. Not Traumatizing him every chance he gets. My
                    favorite moment in this volume was this small scene towards the end when Vash claps his
                    hands and bows to pray at the cross, and Wolfwood makes a comment about being in the
                    wrong faith, which reminded me so much of what <a
                        href=https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Bleeding-of-the-Stone/Ibrahim-al-Koni/9781566564175
                        target=_blank>the bleeding of the stone by ibrahim al-koni</a> is all about. The
                    different ways to pray and worship, the commentary about the “right” and “wrong” way to
                    worship, what the difference it makes as long as you can put “more feeling into it” as
                    Vash says.. I actually thought that moment was really cool. There are lots of
                    connections to be made between Vash as a character and this book actually. I wish I had
                    my book with my notes with me so I could go more in-depth on this... The main character
                    & Vash share similar values on Life and carry radically opposing beliefs to their
                    surrounding character's Kill Maim Destroy (being dramatic here) mindset. Asouf's
                    veganism & Vash's pacifism. Oh wow there's actually so many similarities. Religious
                    themes... struggle between what is good and evil... the twins... Redemption... for Vash
                    and for Cain... I hope I remember these thoughts when I get back home and have the
                    energy to write a paper on this.</p>
                <p><strong>trimax #6:</strong> vash's struggle with self-forgiveness and guilt reminds me a
                    lot of yuuji's struggles in jujutsu kaisen. i was so excited for livio's introduction in
                    this volume! except we didn't see him much. but i think he'll be around more soon. at
                    least, he better. sped through this one so it feels like a blur.</p>
                <p><strong>trimax #7:</strong> I really enjoyed comparing the anime adaptation with the
                    manga for a lot of the scenes in this volume. the tessla flashback scene where they
                    detail the horrors they put her through For The Sake Of Science was truly horrifying.
                    Even more fucked up in the manga than it was in the anime. loved seeing knives be just.
                    absolutely insane here. he's so stupid it's really enjoyable for me. loved all the
                    vashwood moments too. the brothers face off yet again I wonder what disaster will follow
                    in their aftermath...</p>
                <p><strong>trimax #8:</strong> okay this was such an emotional rollercoaster. we see
                    wolfwood try and fail miserably to not gaf as he sees Vash off to his death. Presumably.
                    dramatic goodbyes and all. And after all this time he's spent arguing with Vash on how
                    necessary it is to kill in order to survive, I loved seeing him struggle to do so when
                    it came to Livio (which I was SO happy to see BTW) and with any of the Eye of Micheal...
                    his family.. I know it's mostly because of the brainwashing and conditioning he's been
                    through, but another big part of it is that he was essentially made Parent to all of
                    those children since he was 8 years old. So obviously, there's no way he'd be able to
                    kill them so easily. Especially Livio. God, those Eye of Micheal guys are so evil. “I
                    beg you.. the young ones.. all I wanted was to save them..” was so brutal. But what was
                    even more emotionally devastating was Vash's “that man bet his life on me. He feared
                    death twice as much as the others.. and did his best to hold onto life. You really think
                    I care whether I win or not? He is reason enough to fight.” Oh I wanted to bash my head
                    into the wall. We've already seen that Wolfwood would do anything for Vash, but this
                    coming from Vash was so good to see. Also, that Wolfwood spinoff chapter HURT ME SO
                    BAD.. visiting his kids from the orphanage who don't remember him because they were only
                    babies and because he grew up so much made me so miserable. Every time I see those cult
                    indoctrination flashbacks I feel so miserable.. man..... Wolfwood......</p>
                <p><strong>trimax #9:</strong> LIVIO RAZLO WOLFWOOD FIGHT WAS SOOOO GOOD. more cult content
                    i really loved to see. it is so fucked up that those orphans didn't recognize wolfwood
                    when he saw them again... when one of them was like "i think i knew him when i was
                    younger but.. he shouldn't be that old" a part of me died. wolfwood giving livio a hug
                    trying to get to him.. just so good. i loved seeing razlo he is so much fun. he's really
                    just there to protect livio the only way he knows how (the bad way). i was thinking
                    about how fucked up he is because the only people he has ever had contact with were 1.
                    that evil chapel guy and 2. whichever group of people that would beat up and abuse
                    livio. so he has had 0 socialization besides. protect livio. kill everyone who gets in
                    your way. me personally, i loved seeing my fav guy Wolfwood get pumped full of bullets
                    and then stand back up. i really like how they set this up as a battle between
                    wolfwood's past and present. both literally (livio representing who he was, versus him
                    now) and thematically (?) (wolfwood's internal monologue battle between what he has
                    Always Known and what he loves about vash) it's just so good. i am so excited but so
                    nervous for volume 10..</p>
                <p><strong>trimax #10:</strong> i will never be the same.</p>
                <p><strong>trimax #11:</strong> as devastating as the last volume was, I'm really grateful
                    for the new livio & vash friendship. their bond means so much to me. I was so happy to
                    see millie and Meryl reunite with vash, but the pages where Millie cries because she
                    didn't get to say Goodbye to wolfwood made me tear up for realsies. The paneling, her
                    expression right before she starts to cry.. Vash unable to look her in the eye because
                    he knows his face will give it all away.. everything about that was incredible. Also.
                    Zazie pulling a control bug out of her cooch was the LAST thing I expected out of this
                    volume. Appreciated, though. Meryl & Vash's special fist bump made me cry. It's just.
                    Too cute. And the fact that I now know the story behind Livio's hat makes me love him so
                    much more (than I already did).</p>
                <p><strong>trimax #12:</strong> OH. knives.. really doesn't like having guns pointed at him,
                    huh.. this fight between vash and knives so fucking Beautifully written I'm going to
                    throw up. Vash trying to protect human life and stop knives from Arrogantly pulling the
                    trigger Only for the military to do just that.. oh man that was so good I had to close
                    my eyes for a bit and let that simmer. Their conflict is just so good.</p>
                <p><strong>trimax #13:</strong> RAZLO COMEBACK LETS GOOO! oh how I've missed you silly man..
                    the livio razlo elendira fight was actually so much fun. the quick memory panels of
                    wolfwood and of razlo and vash after seeing that vial drop in the middle of the fight
                    were so good. god and when livio asks for razlo's forgiveness.. I almost cried it's just
                    all so beautifully done. razlo deserves so much love and care he cares so much. About
                    livio. and his ness friends. Having someone to protect. this volume was dedicated for
                    razlo lovers and I'm so glad nightow did this for Me. Personally.</p>
                <p><strong>trimax #14:</strong> god i don't have the energy to write out my full thoughts on
                    this but. what a perfect manga series. seriously. the ending was perfect. vash is
                    perfect. knives. perfect. everything. so good. perhaps i'll be more coherent with this
                    later but i can't wait for some time to pass so i can reread this again.</p>

                <img src=/pics/library/dorevenge.png class=cover>
                <p>i was debating whether or not to give this 4 or 5 stars. i couldn't come up with a reason
                    to knock it down a star. so this movie was 5 stars. it was so enjoyable. i watched this
                    with my cousin and it was so great. visually, the costume designs and the set and the
                    whole Look of the movie was so appealing. i wish i went to a school that had such nice
                    school colors. this was a really simple, cute, and silly movie, i loved the revenge
                    plots and the obnoxious fake woke liberalism of it all. and i loved it especially
                    because i did NOT see that plot twist coming! i predicted a bunch of other smaller
                    things throughout (because i like doing that) but this wowed me. and i love that they
                    got back together in the end and bonded. for most of the movie i was rooting for the
                    revenge duo to become endgame, but i'm glad they didn't. or at least, i'm really happy
                    with their friendship. a very fun watch. would recommend.</p>

                <p>i don't have many thoughts on this but i enjoy junji ito's horror stories. the edition i
                    had included a couple bonus pages of his notes after each chapter, and i thought it was
                    cool to see the beginning stages of each of these stories. my personal favorite was the
                    one with the puppet masters being controlled by the puppets. the evil french puppet had
                    such a fun energy to him and i loved how everyone was lured into being controlled by
                    little strings. i think if it were me i'd willingly join in. and then die, obviously. i
                    was not made to be a surviving horror series character.</p>

                    style=background-color:transparent><img src=/pics/library/trigunmanga.png class=cover></a>
                <p>after watching the new trigun stampede anime, i was really excited to start reading the
                    manga it was based off of because i couldn't get enough of vash, wolfwood, meryl... and
                    i am especially looking forward to more livio/razlo content too. one of my friends is
                    reading it and i'm catching up so we can chat about our favorite sillies. i love the
                    slight difference in characterization of vash in the manga. i'm sure it's probably just
                    because this is the beginning of his story, but i love how silly he is in trigun! there
                    was a moment where he meets this kid, buys his Obviously Fake Sob Story, feeds him, and
                    then jumps into an existential crisis monolgoue about if humankind really deserve to
                    live on such a planet. it's moments like these that have me thinking that him and
                    wolfwood really do just Get each other. freaks who ride on the same wavelength. i also
                    love that meryl and millie are gay in this. and that they adopted a cat together. i
                    would love a bonus chapter (or two... or three or four) of those two engaging in silly
                    mundane antics i think it would be so fun to see them in some low stakes situations. i
                    was not expecting their dynanic to be explored so much in this part of the series, but
                    i'm so glad it was. i tend to get very attached to characters that value Family as much
                    as millie does, and being able to see her aggressively fight for her values was really
                    fun. for such a silly seeming gal she has a lot of depth to her that i appreciate. so
                    excited to read more!</p>
                <p>after reading volume 2 of trigun, I have to say I really like Wolfwood's characterization
                    in the manga! Compared to the anime, he's way more queer! And a lot more giddy and
                    charming while still having 0 social skills. It's a really fun side to him I didn't
                    expect but love very much. I am interested to see how his dynamic with zazie & co.
                    unfolds given how insanely quick Wolfwood has taken a liking to Vash after speaking to
                    him for about three minutes. even I was taken aback by the “So you can smile… You always
                    smile so cheerfully but it's so empty. I can see you hurting.” Immediately followed by
                    Vash asking him out on a date. There's so much homoeroticism between vashwood in the
                    manga already and I've barely even started. I'm hoping season 2 of the anime picks up on
                    these elements because I really do love their dynamic so much more now that I've read
                    the manga. one last moment that stood out to me was in their last fight, where this rich
                    girl is held hostage and she finds out her dad killed people and stole land for her to
                    live the life she has.... and Vash hits her with <span style=color:#9a6aa9;font-style:italic>“I
                        don't think you're stupid enough to ignore
                        those on whom your life was built?”</span> Which is just such a great line. It made
                    me take Vash a little more seriously (when I put my media analysis hat on) because I
                    really wasn't resonating with the sacrificial vibes he had going on in the anime and the
                    beginning of the manga. While I don't care what happens to that rich girl I am so
                    looking forward to seeing how these thoughts grow along with Vash in Trigun Maximum!</p>

                <p>i can't believe i hadn't watched this movie earlier! this is such a cute iconic lesbian
                    movie, putting it right up there with D.E.B.S. it's really funny and silly but at the
                    same time gives us such genuine and sweet moments about accepting yourself and being who
                    you are. "there's not just one way to be a lesbian" truer words have never been spoken.
                    god bless the old man yaoi and the short but sweet old woman yuri appearances in this
                    movie. natasha's performance in this was incredible this is the first movie i've seen of
                    her when she was younger. she was adorable! my one and only complaint (otherwise, it
                    really would have been a perfect movie) is that the characters all seem to not know that
                    trans people exist? poor jan really liked guys the whole time. jan was just a guy. but
                    that thought didn't cross anyone's mind. at all. despite showing up with a buzz-cut and
                    a mustache. i was a little disappointed that jan quit and was never seen again without
                    getting her chance to have gender revelations the same way everyone else had sexuality
                    revelations. but other than mishandling jan's character, i loved everything else about
                    this movie. would totally recommend!</p>

                <p>(rip to shion's face that got lost during the dithering process, lol) i re-watched this
                    with my friend lola for the first time in years, and i fell in love with the series all
                    over again. it's so unfortunate that you can't find this on any mainstream streaming
                    platform.... you really have to know a guy who knows a guy to get your hands on this
                    beautiful show. the main cast are such a lovable group of characters you really can't
                    help but fall for every single one of them. i usually don't tend to enjoy the naive
                    sheltered type, but shion is written in such a way that balances his privileged
                    upbringing with these new truth of reality that nezumi sort of introduces him to. that
                    was a werid way of saying what i meant but i'm too tired to be as thorough for this
                    entry. i really love the political undertones to this story i thought it was a very
                    well-done critique on capitalist and colonial power structures. the first and second
                    time i watched this, i gave it a perfect 5 stars, but after this re-watch i was
                    wondering with my friend if this had a manga series it was based off, and after quickly
                    reading through the last few chapters we realized there was so much important content
                    and a pretty big change in story that wasn't included in the anime. that alone made me
                    knock it a point because i feel like the things that were missing from the anime were
                    pretty important to the overall story and gave it more weight. so i was sad to see them
                    fumble on that one. i do plan to read the manga from start to finish and pour over that
                    more in-depth, so you'll probably see an entry later on the manga. overall i still have
                    lots of love for no. 6, and i'm so excited to see how the manga differs from the
                    anime...</p>

                    style=background-color:transparent><img src=/pics/library/trigun.png class=cover></a>
                <p>i just watched the last episode of trigun stampede and i'm currently feeling LOTS of
                    emotions as i prepare to word vomit my thoughts on here (as i always do). this one has
                    been especially popular lately.. i don't usually like watching shows that i'm seeing all
                    over my twitter timeline because i hate having expectations for things, but trigun
                    wiggled it's way out of every expectation in a way that was actually fun.
                <p>
                <p>despite the first three episodes being a bit slow for me to get through, i was really
                    drawn into the religious tones to the show. i am a sucker for characters that ramble
                    incoherently about God which is what made Wolfwood end up one of my favorite characters
                    from this series. he was my First favorite because of his character design and the fact
                    that his introduction consisted of a) getting hit by a truck b) pretending to be a
                    priest for Who knows why and c) "no matter how big of a cross you carry you still
                    deserve to eat and to smile" which. is really insane. this man lives his life
                    interacting with people while having absolutely no emotional intelligence and i think
                    that's really enjoyable. i always love the freaks that make it clear they have
                    absolutely no idea how to behave like a human being and have no intentions of starting
                    now. this is wolfwood and i love it.</p>
                <p>i wasn't <i>hooked</i> on the show until the wolfwood and livio childhood flashback
                    episode (i think it was 6?). that was honestly probably the most brilliantly written
                    flashback episode i have ever seen. the change in animation style and the lack of
                    dialogue gave the memories such a raw feeling to them i think it is such a perfect way
                    to make me care so much about a character who lives and dies in the same episode and
                    also give so much emotional (?) depth to wolfwood in such a short amount of time and
                    still make it meaningful. i loved it i love livio and i hope we somehow get more of him
                    in the manga and/or in season 2...</p>
                <p>i think my favorite part was how season one ended. i think during the last three episodes
                    is when i really started to get what was going on between knives and vash and that's how
                    i really fell in love with millions knives. what a fucking whack-job! i love him because
                    there were so many instances throughout the series where i thought he almost had
                    something going for him ideologically, in terms of human exploitation and liberation and
                    things of that sort. it seems all he really wants is for vash to be by his side but he's
                    just doing such a godawful job at convincing him to join his fight. nai so badly wants
                    both worlds but has no actual plan to execute this. he really just thinks he can do
                    whatever he wants and that vash will just follow along... because they are brothers. he
                    is so out of touch, these type of guys are my favorite characters because it's so much
                    fun to explore their fucked up thought processes. like. it's great that knives thinks
                    manipulating vash's memories and decapitating the memory of his beloved mother is A
                    Great Bonding Moment Actually. the fact that this actually makes sense to knives is so
                    endearing. while none of his reasoning actually make sense, he clearly has put so much
                    thought into why he does the things that he does and for his. i adore him.</p>
                <p>what really got me was the final episode... the fight between vash and knives. i was
                    already starting to get emotional about the army unloading their entire arsenal on vash
                    while he's trying to protect them all... and im thinking wow this feels very biblical (i
                    have not read the bible but im thinking i probably should at this point). then i'm hit
                    with vash's single busted up angel wing and the whole thing starts feeling really sad.
                    only to get hit AGAIN with knives pulling up with a busted up angel wing on the other
                    side, so it's like if two halves made a whole and that really got to me. the fight was
                    miserable from start to finish because they both were just desperately clawing at the
                    other hoping that what they wanted in each other would reveal itself only for it to Not.
                    i loved it because it was so... unproductive. it was so beautiful but so heartbreaking
                    to see these two brothers who clearly still love each other but want the other to be
                    something they're not. i live for fucked up family dynamics and especially when the
                    family is as tight-knit as these twins. for them to have been so close but fall on
                    opposite extremes of the spectrum of morality and humanity was so good. by that i mean i
                    see vash as way too optimistic about humanity (he really does feel like an Angel at the
                    end) that it costs him his own self-worth and sense of self. whereas nai is so
                    pessimistic he just wants to kill god. a fallen angel perhaps.</p>
                <p>i thought this series was really well done... so good that in fact i Will be starting the
                    manga immediately after because my friend Cloud tells me we get more of some favorite
                    characters of mine. so i am very much looking forward to that.</p>

                <p>spider-man & venom: double trouble</p>
                <img src=/pics/library/spidervenom.png class=cover>
                <p>stopped by the comic place on my way home from work today to pick up some spider-punk
                    issues and i also randomly picked this out alongside it because the cover looked fun. i
                    have seen this venom guy before but i haven't seen his movie or know anything else about
                    him. so this right here is my first introduction to venom as a character and <i>boy</i>
                    was it a great one. i'm sure venom is a much scarier villain when he's in more dramatic
                    and intense situations but this super chill and funny setting was the Perfect way to
                    introduce his character to me. i fell in love with the art style so fast and i felt it
                    was so fitting for this kind of story. spidey and venom being roommates was so funny but
                    also so cute and wholesome. i loved that they were actually friends. and gay. even
                    though venom doesn't pay rent eats all his food and says things like "honey, i'm home!"
                    spidey never kicks him out. which i think is really sweet. this also happened to be the
                    most transgender work of fiction i've read in so long. and i'm being so serious. venom
                    swapping bodies with spider-man so he can participate in what is essentially american
                    ninja warrior because that is the only way he'd be allowed to do that. and the fact that
                    moving around in spider-man's body came so naturally to him? he was so smooth and it
                    felt natural to him meanwhile the spider-man in venom's body was clumsy and Struggling
                    the whole time. that says a lot i think. the second body swap with the squirrel and the
                    cat (which venom actually keeps as a pet...) was unexpected and so cute i loved every
                    moment. seriously i can't think of anything bad to say about these issues i loved them
                    so much. i love making mundane aus of any sort of intense dramatic story and these guys
                    did all the work for me and wrapped it up in a beautiful fully colored package. it was
                    amazing! i can't wait to read the rest of the spider-man comics i bought...

                <p>spider-man: across the spider-verse</p>
                <img src=/pics/library/atsv.png class=cover>
                <p>i watched into the spider-verse when it first came out in theaters a few years ago, and i
                    loved it a lot. i watched this one last night in theaters again. i got home and
                    immediately <s>found it online for free and</s> watched it again because WOW. and today
                    i just watched it for a third time with my friend. i guess you could say i loved this
                    movie <i>a lot</i>... the animation was absolutely BEAUTIFUL i loved reading a few
                    tweets here and there about how they animated hobie brown in particular (one of my
                    favorites). i won't talk too much on the animation aspect because i don't know much
                    about Animation but just know from my humble perspective it was SPECTACULAR. i loved the
                    first half of the movie so much it was honestly perfect. i feel like i can't say much on
                    the second half of the movie because all the thoughts i have right now rely on what
                    happens in the second movie. i don't know anything about original spider-man lore so i
                    am feeling a little behind.... but i am so invested and i've been so obsessed with this
                    movie for the past 24 hours i feel like i should pick up the comics so i actually know
                    what the fuck i'm talking about, you know?
                <p>
                <p>(please take this with a grain of salt) but my thoughts so far on the movie are that i've
                    read it in two ways. the first way (which i think is the main reading because i got this
                    from my friend who knows a lot more about spider-man than i do, and this resonated with
                    me the most) is that this movie is a commentary on the spider-man story itself, and how
                    the writers and fan are so obsessed with this Canon storyline that the more you try to
                    force characters into, the more watered down the character and story becomes. and miles
                    our shining star is the spider-man that breaks the canon by doing what spider-man is
                    supposed to do, save everyone. which contrasts miguel & co.'s insistence on sacrificing
                    the few to save the many.. and miles breaking that canon is allowing for spider-man
                    himself to have a more developed character and be more true to himself. regardless of
                    whether that's right or not that's what i've gathered from it. and i like that.... idk i
                    am feeling so nervous talking about spider-man like this because.... i hate being wrong
                    about things and i know the chances are high because i haven't read the comics yet and
                    since this movie is all about that i could be missing something huge... but whatever</p>
                <p>oh i also wanted to add my thoughts following this on why gwen and peter were so awful to
                    miles during this movie. not writing wise, as in they were awful friends to him. this
                    may or may not be a hot take, i haven't seen anybody talk about this besides the 1am
                    conversation i had with my friend lola on this. i think the way gwen and peter treated
                    miles during the movie (leaving him out of spidey hq, standing there and doing nothing
                    while miguel was beating the shit out miles, turning against him when he was forced to
                    accept his dad's death) served to draw that distinction between characters who are
                    "stuck" in the canon (gwen, peter, all the other spider-people) and those who break that
                    canon (miles) (and also in a way, hobie and margo. i'll come back to these two later).
                    what stood out to me was how hobie and margo both did more for miles than gwen and peter
                    did in the whole movie, by teaching him to use his palms and by letting him go home.
                    whereas gwen peter and miguel were all so hellbent on trying to morph miles into the
                    spider-man they think he should be, the one that they believe is the true "canon"
                    spider-man. which is not who he is! so i really liked that.</p>
                <p>i don't think this alternative reading was intended but a lot of the scenes between
                    miguel peter and miles about the sacrifices they <i>must</i> make and the pain they
                    <i>must</i> endure made me think of generational trauma and cycles of harm. we saw
                    jessica drew say things like "i made that mistake too, but i got over it" and miguel
                    insisting that because he and all the other spider-people went through the trauma and
                    pain of losing their dad, so did miles. and they sort of force this on him. to which
                    miles points out how fucked up that is! instead of fighting for a universe where one
                    spider-man doesn't have to go through that (which is actually exactly what miles does
                    with pavitr! by saving that captain guy he not only breaks the Canon but he breaks that
                    cycle of pain that every spider-man seems doomed to experience.. but pav is spared from
                    that because of miles <i>saving everyone</i>), those guys continue that cycle of pain
                    because it's the Canon... that "i went through this so you have to too" attitude made me
                    think of the kinds of dynamics that occur between generations in families, which i
                    thought was fun. i just wanted to write that down.

                <p>maybe i'll come back to this and add or edit stuff if i'm atrociously wrong about
                    something after i read the comics and watch the next movie. that cliffhanger was insane
                    and i can't believe they actually did that. i want to have complete thoughts on this
                    incredible movie but it's hard when this is only half the story we started off with,

                <p>out of all the disaster movies like this i've seen before, this was actually the best of
                    the best. i honestly think this should be like at the Top of whatever this genre of
                    movie is. the way it was shot was sooooooo intense they were playing with my heart rate
                    like a fiddle! i really liked the political aspect of the movie where they showed the US
                    and Japan rejecting the people in the plane and the protests and stuff. and that one
                    moment where the main little girl came to the adults about something (being vague to
                    avoid spoilers lol) and all of the adults listened to her and believed her! which sounds
                    a little silly to point out but it meant a lot to me. and it reminded me of this one <a

                        target=_blank>Nishnaabeg story</a> i read for class a few semesters ago.. also,
                    seeing the unnamed characters say their goodbyes to their families was so gut
                    wrenching.... like Wow. it was so well done. i loved the movie a lot. i <i>do</i> think
                    this story would be so much fun as a tv show. i just really think it would be cool to
                    explore the Insane emotional rollercoaster of accepting death and then moments later
                    being told you Won't be dying actually... like i'm sure that will fuck up people in many
                    different ways.... a sort of Aftermath story would be cool to have for this movie if
                    that makes sense...

                <img src=/pics/library/mermaid.png class=cover>
                <p>ever since i saw they were doing a live action remake starring halle bailey of my
                    favorite disney movie as a child i've been shivering in my timbers in excitement! fun
                    fact when i was really young i would wake up extra early to watch the little mermaid on
                    VCR and one day i wrote Ariel a letter and drew her a picture of herself to profess my
                    love for her. so i thought it would be really smart for me to stuff my letter in with
                    the VHS tape so that when i press play she would Receive my letter. little me thought
                    this was a brilliant plan.. i broke the VCR and we never got it fixed... that's besides
                    the point. i loved the casting for this movie so much, and i was surprised to find
                    prince eric actually enjoyable in this movie! he was great. i didn't like his song so i
                    took out 1/2 a star..... but that was like the only downside. so glad they made this
                    movie... loved it so much.

                <img src=/pics/library/thebear.png class=cover>
                <p>THIS IS SUCH A GREAT SHOW. i originally saw a video edit a year ago with this guy yelling
                    at everybody, and i loved this actor in shameless so my interest was piqued. however i
                    could Not for the life of me find that edit again or the name of the show until 2 days
                    ago, when i finally found it and binged the whole thing in 2 days. me personally, i LOVE
                    getting emotionally manipulated by tv shows. and boy did this show play with my feelings
                    like a fiddle! the bear does such a great job at building tension and making <i>me</i>
                    feel like having a panic attack alongside carmen and dispelling it just like that. that
                    was a poor attempt at explaining what i mean but whatever. i actually adore the whole
                    cast. i'm serious when i say every single character (at the restaurant) is my favorite.
                    the dialogue is so funny but when it gets real it gets <i>real</i>. and they do such a
                    good job with making sure there's a balance. i am so excited for season 2 which is
                    supposed to be coming soon. i need 5 seasons of this show at least i'm SO invested. and
                    i'm dying to know what this BEAR means on a wider scale. it's only appeared in the first
                    and last episode of season one and we learn that both carmen and his dead brother were
                    called Bear....... i'm so interested i need more content to be able to have any
                    substantial theories of whatever this bear really means besides the bear = carmen's
                    issues. i just!!! so much joy and love in my heart for this show and everyone in it.
                    season 2 soon!!!!!!!!</p>
                <p><strong>update 10/9:</strong> i just realized i forgot to update this entry after
                    watching season 2. it's keeping it's 5 stars this season was incredible. richie quickly
                    moving up to be one of my favorite characters of all time, his arc this season was
                    beautiful. i loved seeing sydney slowly lose her mind in the background of this season,
                    and i can only hope this means she will be the focus for the next season. such an
                    incredible series.</p>

                <p>i feel like i'm definitely going to have to come back to this when i am more able to put
                    my thoughts into better words. friends have been begging me to start succession for a
                    year now but looking at this cover photo i really did not think i would like it..... i
                    don't usually watch these business-y type shows, i just don't care for them. but BOY was
                    i WRONG about succession. immediately, the first episode hooked me. i think what first
                    drew me in was the funny dialogue and how the siblings acted like literal children. the
                    contrast between how much power they hold and how they were literally tackling each
                    other over something stupid was something i really enjoyed. the show is SO well done,
                    from a technical standpoint. it seems like they had the CASH for this show and it paid
                    off. i am a sucker for fucked up family dynamics and the roy family...... chefs KISS.
                    most fucked up family i've seen on tv in a while. the ending was GREAT and so SATISFYING
                    god i wish i had to words to express the feeling in my chest right now.... it was just
                    so good and i'm so glad i finally watched it. i cant wait for when enough time has past
                    so i can rewatch it again.

                <p>yes this is my first time watching star wars as well. i'm really not much of a movie guy
                    i tend to enjoy tv shows more often... but here i am. i'm not sure why i keep putting
                    myself through this. anyways i also Surprisingly enjoyed star wars (episode 4) a LOT.
                    the INCREDIBLE special effects aside, i love Mr. Solo. he..... stole my heart. what a
                    guy! my favorite characters in order are: those little cloaked creatures that make
                    little kjsdfghdvhjkweti noises, artoo & threepio, and han solo. i don't care much for
                    luke and leia sorry. glad they got to have their romance moment though. i want to watch
                    the rest but i know it will take me a while because even though i did LOVE this movie,
                    i'm just not a movie guy...... so this will just be a long term project.

                <p>i watched this for the first time last week with my friend during our semi-frequent movie
                    nights!! i felt like i just <i>had</i> to watch this movie at some point in my life,
                    given it's a Classic and is referenced everywhere... and i ended up enjoying it a lot,
                    which surprised me. i will say there was a part in the middle where i zoned out, which i
                    guess means it wasn't that interesting to me but i really loved the concept and i see
                    why everyone went nuts over this when it first came out. i love early 2000s movies about
                    The Internet because they make me nostalgic and i am very interested in how people think
                    of the internet both back in the day and also Now. and this movie itched that spot in my
                    brain. the ending was perfect also i love how he just flew away.. because he Can do
                    that. so silly!

                <p>i just finished volume one of frankenstien, and will update when i finish the rest. i was
                    not expecting to love this as much as i do, and i am so... so in love with this story!
                    here's a ramble of my thoughts so far: while i've only gotten a small glimpse of Walton
                    so far, i do love that he is very much head over heals for Victor the moment they met.
                    they do have so much in common! especially in the way they both adore their sisters. i
                    hope the next volume has more letters from him i would like to know more about what he's
                    like. victor is my favorite! well to be quite honest they're all my favorites right now
                    (walton victor elizabeth justine.. the parallels).</p>
                <p>i'm not sure if it's meant to be funny but I did want to laugh over how quick and
                    dramatic victor's shift was once he Created the creature. i found the "His limbs were in
                    proportion, and I had selected his features as beautiful. Beautiful! Great God!"
                    immediately followed by "A mummy again endued with animation could not be so hideous as
                    that wretch." "...it became a thing such as even Dante could not have conceived" fucking
                    hilarious. i do feel really bad for the creature like he didn't even do anything to be
                    hated so much by his own Mother!!! speaking of. i am of the belief that Victor is a
                    mother suffering from severe post-partum psychosis and depression. that's why he's like
                    that. and says those things. i also really enjoyed his relationship with his Dear Friend
                    Clerval i think they have something really special going on. there's this one excerpt is
                    one of my favorites so far of the book:</p>
                <blockquote style=text-align:justify>but Clerval called forth the better feelings of my
                    heart; he again taught me to love the aspect of nature, and the cheerful faces of
                    children. Excellent friend! how sincerely you did love me, and endeavour to elevate my
                    mind until it was on a level with your own. A selfish pursuit had cramped and narrowed
                    me, until your gentleness and affection warmed and opened my senses;</blockquote>
                <p>i couldn't help but make the connection to <span style=background-color:black>satosugu</span>
                    [redacted]. i hope nothing bad happens
                    to them... i say this because i feel like as long as Victor keeps his secret and lets
                    his abandoned creation run off.. it seems more bad things will happen. Victor is kind of
                    a wuss but i still like him ♡ my favorite queer irresponsible bastard.my last thoughts
                    for now are that i think justine and elizabeth should have kissed before justine died (i
                    love them) i really liked the "Thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and
                    herself." and how those exact words were used to describe Elizabeth masking her own
                    grief for the sake of keeping her family happy. they both just get each other so much.
                    and don't get me started on Elizabeth's last words to her... truly a miserable world it
                    would be without Justine...</p>
                <p><strong>volume 2 update: </strong>I've been speeding through this so fast (I'm just so
                    into this) I forgot to take a moment after finishing volume 2 to write about it... so
                    this will be a shorter entry than the first. until i get inspired and want to write more
                    about it later.</p>
                <p>Victor is really starting to piss me off! Stand up! He is being very woe is me right now,
                    but I will say some of (all of, if we're being serious) these lines are just so
                    beautiful. "Thus not the tenderness of friendship, nor the beauty of earth, nor of
                    heaven, could redeem my soul from woe: the very accents of love were ineffectual." I
                    really liked that one. It's especially interesting considering how Victor desperately
                    tries to ease his soul and find crumbs of happiness when he's surrounded by nature, but
                    even that won't work now. Victor reminds me of all the miserable whiny depressed
                    narrators / main characters in some other things I've read (reminding me a lot of the
                    unnamed narrator from Season of Migration to the North by Tayeb Salih right now). If he
                    thinks he's miserable, wait til he hears the creature's lived experiences!</p>
                <p>I was seriously almost brought to tears twice while reading the creature's story on the
                    train it was so devastating. The creature is literally just a little guy. If Victor
                    hadn't been such a bully and shown him kindness literally none of this would have
                    happened but whatever man. #Don'tJudge. What I love is that the creature has enough
                    reasons right now to be truly evil and kill everyone but he's STILL giving Victor a
                    chance to redeem all of humanity and give him a Frankenshorty. All he wants is
                    companionship and Victor won't even give him that! Who is the real agent of evil and
                    cruelty? I am going to be such a nerd about this and say this part of the creature's
                    dialogue when he says:</p>
                <blockquote style=text-align:justify>'You are in the wrong,' replied the fiend; 'and,
                    instead of threatening, I am content to reason with you. I am malicious because I am
                    miserable. Am I not shunned and hated by all mankind? You, my creator, would tear me to
                    pieces, and triumph; remember that, and tell me why I should pity man more than he
                    pities me? You would not call it murder, if you could precipitate me into one of those
                    ice-rifts, and destroy my frame, the work of your own hands.'</blockquote>
                <p>really reminded me of Meruem's dialogue with Netero in Hunter X Hunter... it was
                    definitely inspired by this it had to have been. Maybe! I can't help but make
                    connections like these. I personally believe Victor should suffer more! I am glad the
                    stars and the heavens that once comforted him now mock him forever! I'll maybe come back
                    with a more thoughtful analysis if I am feeling upto it, there is a lot to be said about
                    responsibility, care, and community from this text, and I'm excited to read the last
                    volume and see how this all ends.</p>
                <p><strong>volume 3 update / final thoughts: </strong>i'm keeping this one shorter because i
                    am on the train and don't feel like writing a lot about this right now but. i loved this
                    book so much. i already want to reread it. the Creature's last words really touched my
                    heart i'm still in awe over how beautifully this was all written... "You hate me, but
                    your abhorrence cannot equal that with which I regard myself"... "My spirit will sleep
                    in peace, or if it thinks, it will not surely think thus. Farewell."... absolutely
                    beautifully devastating. this is going on my Hall Of Fame of books, it's that good. I'm
                    so glad i read this..</p>

                <p>Wah! I am so glad I impulse bought this comic from one of my favorite artists. They draw
                    a lot of fanart that I adore, so I was so psyched to see they have their own works
                    published as well! The Sucker was such a beautiful read, beautifully, literarily, in all
                    the ways. I loved the tense dynamic between the two main friends (EJ and Dani, I
                    believe) the most. Getting those glimpses of their past when they swam together and
                    seeing the way they sort of left off, only to reunite again with all those Complicated
                    feelings about each other really touched me! My chest is full of feelings I can't really
                    explain right now, I just know that it's a good thing. I am truly obsessed with this and
                    I am so glad I got the opportunity to read such a tale. I totally recommend this to
                    literally everyone (and you can click on the cover image to be directed to their site to

                    elementary is the exceptional exception. this show is hilarious! every single episode
                    has me a-kekekeing and heheheing (ﾉ≧∀≦)ﾉ my favorite duo is barbara and melissa, but the
                    character who makes me laugh the most is definitely ava. i love that it's in a school
                    setting too, since i am thinking about becoming a teacher maybe... mimimimi. making as

                <p>i love tv shows that function as if they are puzzles. DARK is so different from all the
                    other time travel shows i've seen, and they play with the concept in such a unique way!
                    it's a bit tragic but also perfect in a way. the writing is incredible, especially in
                    the first two seasons and I truly appreciate how the ending of the series wraps up so
                    nicely. because it's one of those shows where Everything Matters and all the details
                    Mean Something i'm sure I missed a lot, but that's okay. This is a show that was made to
                    be re-watched so I'm excited to do that later on. the casting for this show is actually
                    insanely good. the directors must have sold their souls to find other actors who looked
                    so much like each other to play their older/younger selves. it's really impressive.
                    almost scary. the soundtrack is really great too, i've added <a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMHLkcc9I9c">Irgendwie Irgendwo Irgendwann</a>
                    by NENA to my own playlist. i will say that i enjoyed season 3 a lot less than i did the
                    rest. i wouldn't say it's bad or lacking in quality compared to the first two seasons, i
                    just personally couldn't get into the new World concept. i think the show was already so
                    dense (I liked that) but this new layer was just too much for my little brain. but
                    again, i don't think it was like worse than the others. the writing was just as good and
                    the ending was also nice neat and fitting. i loved it. it just took me forever to get
                    through the last season..</p>

                <p>i read this entire book in one sitting yesterday. i read along with the audiobook CDs i
                    got after seeing jennette speak at my school a few weeks ago. i usually don't enjoy
                    reading memoirs (they bore me) but this is the exception to that. my God was it the most
                    beautifully written work i've read in a while. i simply could not put it down. it was so
                    immersive and emotional (i did tear up a little towards the end...) but also so funny at
                    times. her story is so important and resonated with me in ways i didn't think it would.
                    i honestly think Anyone no matter what books they like to read would enjoy this. so much
                    love in my heart for jennette i am so happy for her and how far she's come. her
                    experiences with the Healing process is something i hold dear to my heart. ah! just such
                    a good book.</p>

                <p>i had initially started reading this because i saw a lot of funny panels where the
                    dialogue looked really silly, but i'm almost caught up now and i genuinely love this
                    series. it's so very intense but the characters are all so loveable and crazy and i love
                    all the portrayals of the different ways to love soccer. it's really fun. i'm probably
                    misleading a few people by describing blue lock in such a wholesome way but it really is
                    a sweet treat for me. my favorite players are shidou, rin, and isagi. and bachira too.
                    but (more importantly) my favorite character dynamics are whatever rin and isagi & also
                    shido and itoshi got going on. i just love it when it's the two characters that seem the
                    most different that end up being the best matches for each other. it's also not that
                    common i care so much about the main character but isagi i am rooting for you! you crazy
                    little boy! いけ いけ いさぎ !

                <p>i impulsively bought this book during my last trip to my local bookstore because i was
                    very curious about this house with chicken legs... it took me a while to get through the
                    book because the pacing was too slow for me to stay hooked for too long. i considered
                    putting it on pause and reading something else for a bit, but i am really glad i didn't
                    do that. i loved the story it had to tell! i am a big fan of stories about stories and
                    generational tales and this book was very much that. plus it was the first time reading
                    a story based in Jewish folklore and I really loved it. isaac was my favorite character,
                    and his past with benji was very fun to read about. i love the way the ending was told..
                    i'm really attached to that house. overall, a good read. i think i would have got
                    through it sooner if i could listen along to the audiobook, but i couldn't find it
                    anywhere for free... </p>

            <p><strong>update (04-02-2023):</strong> a friend told me apparently it's not based on real events at all really and i was tricked by the internet again. i feel so silly but i'll keep up my insane little rant below because although my larger ideas might not apply to swarm anymore, i think i make good points in general. i feel strangely embarrassed but also its okay because who cares</p>
            <p>i think Swarm was beautifully crafted and the acting was incredible. however. the more i think and talk about this show the more i am bothered by this strange feeling i have about what this show actually is. it's hard to describe but it feels a little lost in it's purpose. watching the show, it really feels like it's a fiction thriller show (despite it saying "this is not fiction" in the beginning of every episode), but it's not. now, i don't know much about the actual events this show is based on, but i know it is based on both real life events and rumors, calling itself Not Fiction. this really bothers me. i worry about what it means to take real life events and portray them in a way that feels? fictional? hm. i feel like i'm not doing a great job of expressing what i mean. this just didn't feel as serious as it was, i feel, supposed to be. when reading this show as a non-fiction piece, it feels like another one of those serial killer documentary that glamorizes and makes a spectacle of real killers. which is not great. it also makes me feel weird as a viewer, enjoying what feels like a fun Fictional thriller, and then remembering that this is not fictional and real people were hurt by these events. this is the biggest issue i have with the show, and this exactly is also what makes its commentary on stan culture feel really shallow. now, if this was indeed fiction, i wouldn't mind the shallow commentary because this show doesn't feel like it was that serious to begin with. it's really artistic and beautiful and emotionally engaging and visually appealing, but i think it was missing the more serious undertones it needs. like, those serial killer documentaries are <i>documentaries</i>, so (despite those shows being terrible and incredibly harmful) at least you would know what you're going into before you start watching.</p>
            <p>maybe i'm totally wrong and stupid about this. but i just think this kind of uncertainty? whatever the missing piece is here that's bugging me so much.. is really important to have and without it i feel like it can send weird messages to viewers who are struggling enough with media literacy today. idk man.... the implications are weird. i feel weird!</p>

            <p>after watching the entire first season what i have to say is: man this show is just so beautifully written. and amazingly produced. i think the scene in the season finale where joel is killing everyone in the hospital but the audio is muffled almost like you're putting your hands over your ears was so powerful to me. chefs kiss absolutely brilliant. that will stick with me forever. the worldbuilding is just so cool. i've been seeing side by side comparisons of the show and the game and i am so impressed by how true to the source material they are. i haven't played the games but i know many who have and they all have told me that even though they know what will happen they are still hooked and excited to see what each episode brings. i love joel ellie so much. best duo to ever duo.</p>

        <p>i have taken it upon myself to watch every single scream movie in a row, and i will compile my little Thoughts all into one post because having 6 boxes on SCREAM feels insane. plus i don't think i'll have much to say on each individual one. we'll see though.</p>
        <p><strong>(3/8/23) scream 1:</strong> loved it. too many breaking 4th wall jokes about Horror Movie Structure <i>but</i> the scene where that nerd guy was like "behind you!" and the freaks in the van were watching him and screaming "behind you!" was really funny.</p>
        <p><strong>(3/10/23) scream 2:</strong> i see that the fourth wall thing is a Bit now. i get it. it's fun i do enjoy it now a lot more. i started to get bored halfway though because i just don't care about dewey and Monica (who i know is not actually named monica). but then the end got exciting again. even though i wasn't a fan of the killers this time. felt like something was missing...</p>
        <p><strong>scream 3:</strong> what is sid's kill count at this point my god! they can't let her keep getting away with this!!!!</p>
        <p><strong>(3/11/23) scream 4:</strong> alright we're starting to pick up. better than 3, pretty good. i did get a little bored halfway through tho. again. i loved emma roberts though. i think i would have disliked this one a lot more without her performance. she carried!!!</p>
        <p><strong>scream 5:</strong> i think this one might be my favorite so far. i suddenly care more about dewey and monica now. i've started to love the movie structure monologues they do every time it makes me feel like i'm taking film 101. amber has been my favorite killer so far besides the originals i'd say. the fact that it's all in the same house is a detail i loved. ugh! everything was done so much better.</p>
        <p><strong>scream 6:</strong> an incredible movie!!! i'm so glad i got to see this one in theaters. i absolutely love the killers in this one, the acting was incredible and tbh i supported them! i'll be vague to avoid spoilers since this one is so new, but ahh!!! the twist?! so good. i totally didn't see you-know-who coming back. and then the thing!!! and then he made it!!!!! wow. haha. 5/5. my official ranking as of my Feelings right now are 1, 4+5 all tied for first. then its 4, 2, and then 3. what a great franchise.<s>scream7 now!!!!!!!!!!</s></p>

            <p>i love how adorable this show is. i did enjoy the first season a lot more than the second. especially towards the end with the yue Development and also just getting more growth out of sakura and li. i feel like the pacing was just more to my liking than it was in the second season. but!! i didn't <i>dislike</i> season 2 or anything, it's super cute and i am living for all the yukino and tomoya moments... (the best part of the entire series tbh) they mean so much to me (´｡• ω •｡`) ♡</p>
