                            Anywhere can be paradise as long as you have the will to live. After all, you are alive, so
                            you will always have the chance to be happy. As long as the Sun, the Moon, and the Earth
                            exist, everything will be all right.

                            I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total
                            obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when
                            it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there
                            will be nothing. Only I will remain.

                            At lunchtime I bought a huge orange--<br />
                            The size of it made us all laugh.<br />
                            I peeled it and shared it with Robert and Dave--<br />
                            They got quarters and I had a half.

                            And that orange, it made me so happy,<br />
                            As ordinary things often do<br />
                            Just lately. The shopping. A walk in the park.<br />
                            This is peace and contentment. It's new.

                        <p>
                            The rest of the day was quite easy.<br />
                            I did all the jobs on my list<br />
                            And enjoyed them and had some time over.<br />
                            I love you. I'm glad I exist.
