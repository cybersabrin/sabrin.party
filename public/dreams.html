    <p style="width:75%; margin: 0 auto;">i do not dream very often. and when i do, they are incredibly boring dreams. thankfully, i average about 2 dreams a month. so i don't bore myself into a coma. which makes me wonder why i bother uploading these online? for fun. because it's christmas 2025 and i'm bored.</p>

  <h2>february 18, 2026</h2>
  <p>dreamt that i was cast in a bloodsick productions movie. to be a singer in a nu metal band? but we were talking about leaning more towards metal because i can't actually sing at all. i was exploring the house we were in, it was filled with lots of interesting clutter. i was meant to be a monster of sorts in the movie. i found of notebook with notes on the movie and it said that i was cast because my face and my voice is deceiving which i think was a compliment.</p>
  <h2>february 6, 2026</h2>
  <p>dreamt that i got into the grad program i wanted to, except i got no scholarships or aid so i couldn't do it. was devastated. woke up to avoid thinking about what to do next...</p>
  <h2>january 24, 2026</h2>
  <p><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/1zVJ1HFD/gta.webp" style="float: right;"> dreamt that i was being chased GTA-style by the military because i didn't have a copy of my birth certificate. they were at my house and went through my documents and they saw that my 'birth certificate' was a typed up word document i made when i was 8 years old that said my birthday in times new roman 12pt font and included a baby photo of me. very much not a birth certificate. so they started chasing me like krista the security guard from high school. and i started running around the city hiding from them and evading them unsuccessfully until i reached the city hall and that's when i woke up. it honestly sounds a lot more high stakes than it was when i was living the dream, like it was stressful that i was being chased but i wasn't that stressed out about it.</p>
  <h2>december 29, 2025</h2>
  <p>another group chat dream. it's so funny to me that i dream of group chats. anyways the group chat with me and oumaima and my sister was revived all of a sudden and we were talking about how much we loved the movie <i>Him</i>. then i woke up.</p>
  <h2>december 18, 2025</h2>
  <p>barely remember it, i just know i was talking to someone about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUMR3cR1qSY&list=RDzUMR3cR1qSY&start_radio=1" target="_blank">a real indication by thought gang</a> and i was all like <i>and my shooooooes are so far away from me</i> and then i heard a car honk and i woke up.</p>
  <h2>november 21, 2025</h2>
  <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/cLPD0jZr/dreamlottie.png" style="float: left; height: 200px;" title="cult leader lottie matthews you can take my phone and waterboard me any time"> <p>nightmare. i went to this isolation meditation retreat thing where they took our phones away for healing purposes. me and some strangers were staying at this beautiful compound. very naturepilled and outdoorsy but when i wanted to get my phone back and call home to let my mom know i made it safely they said no. which is when i started to panic and then i started screaming <i>MAMA!</i> toddler tantrumstyle, and that's when the leader showed up. she was a beautiful older woman dressed all hippie like, kinda like lottie matthews from yellowjackets, but it wasn't actually her in my dream. just, the same genre of person. anyways so she comes out and tells me "of course you can call home. follow me and i'll take you to where i put your phone." so i follow her and she takes me to this beautiful gigantic pond, and honestly it looked a lot like the background of this webpage. heavenly. and she points to the middle of the big body of water and says "there's your phone" and that's when i realize i'm stuck here. i start to panic again but that's when the evil beautiful cult leader grabs the back of my neck and starts waterboarding me. not a fun time, but i woke up as soon as i realized the torture scene was going to go on for a while.</p>
  <p>i am scared of drowning but i so rarely ever have nightmares that this one felt exciting and enjoyable. i think this one was inspired by my latest read, <i>the golden raven</i> by nora sakavic, and it seems that jean moreau's waterboarding trauma has been passed down to me.</p>
  <h2>october 26, 2025</h2>
  <p>long time no dream. dreamt that carlea finally texted me back normalstyle and not on discord which just feels so wrong and cursed and incorrect. woke up and this wasn't true. Tragic.</p>
  <h2>july 15, 2025</h2>
  <p>i was at costco trying to do some grocery shopping when fbi agent adams from riverdale accosted me and forced me to infiltrate a nearby hotel with a mic on me as a spy for god knows what, he wouldn't tell me. i didn't wanna do it at all but he was fbi and scary so i did. so i was in this hotel room and then my mom walked in on me and i said i was doing a company tour? i was so guilty for some reason, like i had just killed someone? then i woke up.</p>
  <h2>june 13, 2025</h2>
  <p>i was at a weird place that looked like if comicopia and newbury comics had a baby in harvard square. i was browsing some comics and zines and towards the back, there was a huge open space that looked like a fancy restaurant but it was outside in the grass. at night. i'm hanging around towards the way back and i run into grace! and we chat for a bit and then she had to go home because it was late and i was like woah if she's going home because it's late then what the hell am i doing out here? and then i woke up.</p>
  <h2>june 6, 2025</h2>
  <p>stupid nothing dream. had a dream that i was getting a pedicure but i didn't want a pedicure. so i was just like, bummed. and uncomfortable. and then i woke up.</p>
  <h2>may 14, 2025</h2>
  <p>accidentally slept at cait and bil's house and woke up suddenly at 8:45PM and i was freaking out because i was going to be in big touble. i woke up sad from this one.</p>
  <h2>april 28, 2025</h2>
  <p>me, flavia, caitlyn, carlea, and nabila were all trapped in a nice fancy house and donald trump wouldnt let us leave. it wasn't a nightmare, the vibes weren't scary but we <i>were</i> trapped in there. and we were doing arts and crafts the whole time. a kind of calm chaos that makes sense for me to dream up because it's how i feel all the time. i kept looking for something in my arts and crafts bin thay could get us out but i got nuthin'. carlea was at a computer desk w a phone and was secretly calling for help and when donald trump realzied this he <i>RAN SO FAST</i> to hang up the phone and i was like "DT be honest... how often do you work out to be able to run that fast." and i didn't mean this in a flirty way i know that's a flirty question but i was just like how did he move like that. and he said "once a week." and then i woke up.</p>
  <h2>march 12, 2025</h2>
  <p>i was at a hospital? or a weird doctor's office. nothing was really happening i was just there for a bit before i woke up. boring as hell.</p>
  <h2>march 9, 2025</h2>
  <p>i was back in our old apartment having a sleepover with owen? haven't seen the guy since high school. and i was trying to turn the light off to go to bed but it would not turn off no matter how hard i tried and mama tried also turning it off and she was also very suspicious of my backpack and i was stressed about that and then i woke up.</p>
  <h2>february 23, 2025</h2>
  <p>so me and flavia are going to the movies at assembly and it's kinda late but somehow i'm allowed. i don't even know what the movie is about because about 10 minutes into the movie i realize forgot something so important that i had to go home to get it and come back. mid movie. whatever. i go and then suddenly i'm at home re-tying my shoes to go back to the movies and i half-wake up at this point bc i know im in bed but im still in dream mode so im like "oh no why did i get in bed flavia's waiting for me at the movies!"</p>
  <p>so i go back outside and for some reason i stop at cvs (and i'm also in harvard square now) and i get a king sized sharpie and im ready to vandalize some sidewalks so the city repaves them. some people outside were giving me ideas like "FUCK SHIT BITCH write those!!!" and i was like "yeah!!!!!" i'm walking down the street and one cop gets out his car and walks up to me looking scared and mad and pulls out his gun and i'm like WHAT. i Immediately drop the pen and hands on my head. suddenly i'm surrounded by like 6 COPS and I'm FREAKING OUT because already this is a crazy reaction to have to my unexecuted vandalization ATTEMPT...</p>
  <p>and i'm like oh my god what is going on. one lady cop pulls out the marker from my hand and is like "what is this?" and i'm like "it's a king size sharpie" and she was surprised they existed she's never seen one before. and i was like about to pee my pants bc i was like you cannot be surprised by me at all please stop being surprised it's normal ITS NORMAL. and they have me standing there frozen in place for so long and I'm like oh my god flavia is waiting for me at the movies and i can't even text her back.</p>
  <p>two cops move and walk behind me to look around the block and i look back and i realize that was a mistake bc the other cop says “the moon glows blue over the mountains” i say "What does that meannnnn" and he doesn't answer. they come back after so long and i glimpse its 10:45 on someone's phone and i'm like "um can i pay a fine and go home i really have strict parents and it's already late but i really need to be home before 11:30" and they laughed at me and were like "A FINE????" and i was like YES???? WHY WHAT HAPPENED??? because i asked what happened before and they didn't tell me. i have no idea why they're being so dramatic about this. and they aked me "why a fine?" and so i fessed up i was like "i'm so sorry okay i bought that sharpie so i can write all over the sidewalk because i was mad they're always messed up and i'm always tripping over them and wanted the city to replace them" and they looked genuinely confused and i was like ?????? and i asked them again did something happen?? but it was quiet around me and i was close to the center of harvard square and there was no commotion and they didn't answer me but they didn't let me go either. and then i woke up.</p>
  <h2>february 16, 2025</h2>
  <p>this is so stupid. i dreamt the yellowjackets dine and dash scene and everything was the same except i was tai and when i went back to go pay i actually paid and i thought it was going to be 600$ for that fuck ass cotton candy but i looked at my discover bank statement and it was $100,000 and i was like nooooooo and then i woke up.</p>
  <h2>february 1, 2025</h2>
  <p>had a dream within a dream, but i'm struggling to remember what the inner dream was. fuck! i almost had it, i just remember it being so funny that it woke up dream me. i used know know what it was... but its lost now. i also dreamt that i got hair extensions but they looked so terrible... hated them. not even a headband could save me...</p>
  <h2>january 16, 2025</h2>
  <p>first dream of the year. i was hanging out with laura palmer and donna hayward (movie donna). they were smoking and asked me if i wanted one. i (hypnotized) said yes of course i'd give myself lung cancer to hang out with you some more. they gave me one and it turned into a joint in my hands. they got up to go smoke outside, left through a door. said goodbye, and then i woke up.</p>
  <blockquote>note: a few hours after i woke up from this dream i found out david lynch had died. such a beautiful and strange coincidence that made me cry into my lunch that day.</blockquote>
  <h2>november 21, 2024</h2>

  <h2>october 11, 2024</h2>

  <h2>october 1, 2024</h2>
  <p>i was at this place I've never been to before and me and flávia were on a couch facing the door and then caitlyn came in and she had the cutest little outfit on. it was like a denim midi skirt with like a sheer green leafy patterned top and like some headband that matched but i can't imagine it that clearly, i mostly forget. it was cute. anyways for some reason caitlin brought these extra strength sleeping pills and i took one by accident idk why but i plopped one in my mouth and everyone was like oh nooooo and then i woke up</p>
  <h2>september 29, 2024</h2>

  <h2>june 21, 2023</h2>
  <p>dreamt a sequel to the first noah's arc dream. so i'm working at the same retail store and me and my Coworker who is actually Natasha Lyonne and we decided it would be a good idea for us to pull that stunt ourselves this time.</p>
  <p>so we plan it out on a day we're both working in the store for all the animals to show up. and we're like “omfg againnnnn?!” acting all surprised and all but this time when the cops come they lock down the <i>entire mall</i> and they're like "we're not unlocking the mall until whoever did this confesses. and whoever did this would get 7-10 years in federal prison" which made me so mad and also scared because how come the first guys get off easy but when I do it it's 7-10 years. that's so fucked up. and then I was like considering turning myself in because I don't wanna wait til one of us breaks but I can't do prison like I just can't. hours pass and suddenly Natasha is gone? I'm thinking Aw she turned herself in for me and maybe we can start a budding romance behind bars La la la. then i realize maybe she dipped so I did too. Unclear how I made it out but I did.</p>
  <p>then i'm outside running in the suburbs and it's summer and it's 1982 for some reason but I remember it distinctly being 1982. I eventually catch up to her running in front of me but we don't speak we just have an unspoken understanding and the says goodbye in her own cryptic way and leaves forever and I keep running thru the suburbs and I run past billy from stranger things doing swim lessons (I don't talk to him I just run past him) and keep running and then the movie (my dream) ends.</p>
