<p>i think for now i'll be using this as a personal blog / journal where i talk about my day as a means to practice html and such. these will probably be boring (or probably not... guess you'll have to read them to find out. i don't make the rules)</p>

    <button type=button class=collapsible><time>2024-02-15</time>: inside mari essay is a zine now..</button>
    <div class=content>
    <p>the essay? thing. i wrote yesterday now exists in zine form. i just really didn't want to study for calc. i'm doomed. but its okay. i've accepted this failure. i'll just have to do better on the next quiz. wah.</p>
    <iframe src="https://itch.io/embed/2531694?border_width=0&amp;bg_color=fef8f8&amp;fg_color=9e2835&amp;link_color=e53b44" class="insidemarizine"><a href="https://atsumeow.itch.io/inside-mari">yearning: inside mari by sabrin</a></iframe>
    <p>now i'm feeling like i should have a dedicated space for the writings that aren't like. me complaining and talking about my day and stuff. i usually put stuff like this in my shrines but this doesn't fit into one. hm.... will i start writing more essays like these? maybe? some redesigning needs to be done...</p>

    <button type=button class=collapsible><time>2024-02-15</time>: yuri zine has changed my brain chemistry</button>
    <div class=content>
    <p>so. internet user <a href="https://longposter.neocities.org/#" target="_blank" class="bloglink">tshirt</a> who i admire greatly posts a lot about YAOI ZINE. a collaborative anthology zine about yaoi. the first one i read was vol 2 or as i call it, the jstor yaoi. i had missed the window the order my physcial copy so i was reading the pdf but i never actually finished it. i just hate reading on online screens so it usually takes me longer. but jstor yaoi was the beginning of my Intense Love for this zine. because the one thing that probably makes me feel the most alive in this world is talking about what is considered to be unserious things (media in general, but specifically Cartoons and yaoi) in very serious ways. there is meaning to that. and the essays ive read made me feel so seen and also so.. real. in case you havent noticed somehow i fucking love talking about the media i consume but i sometimes (a lot of the time) struggle to articulate some of the more complicated concepts i want to talk about. and the brilliant minds behind this zine cracked open my skull and went oh! so you meant this! and give me the words i needed for everything to make sense. anyways i'm starting to ramble and i havent even mentioned the point of this post. i hear yaoi zine volume 3 is coming out and this time its YURI. so i'm like hell yeah and i got my physical copy. i love reading paper in my hands. was so excited for it. i got it in the mail yesterday and i quite literally haven't put it down since. and i'm not even done yet (i forced myself to stop with like 20 pages left because i want this to last logner...). just so you know how much i love this thing.</p>
    <p>so its a little past midnight and i'm rereading one of the earlier sections of the yuri zine and i come back to this quote, <strong>"sometimes when looking at my self is as painful as staring directly into the sun, my solution has typically been to study the reflection in the moon"</strong> and it all just sort of hit me. holy hell. <u>inside mari</u>. to study yourself thorugh another pair of eyes, in her case.<img src="/images/blog-posts/2024/ramblingsofaMadMan.jpg" style="width: 200px; float: left; padding-right: 5px; padding-top: 5px;"> this language unlocked so many different ways of understanding inside mari that i just started scribbling on my ipad until next thing i knew an hour had passed and i ran out of white space and <i>how did i even get here?</i> anyways. here is the batshit insane looking page where i dumped all the thoughts i'm going to attempt to organize in paragraph form? open it in a new tab if you really want to actually read that monster of a thing.</p>
    <strong>the horror of Looking at your own self.</strong><p>a lot of yuri zine talked about reading and interacting with yuri as a form of self identification. and how those bring up both good feelings (gender validating) and bad feelings (confronting yourself and your regret and your shame for whatever reasons you may have). both as a consumer of this media but also found within the characters themselves in the stories we read. considering how the big reveal of the entire story is about how. in an attempt to identify herself, mari was forced to truly <i>look</i> at herself. something she literally couldn't handle. throughout the zine, the authors all in one way or another touch upon the idea of how uncomfortable it is to confront yourself. to look at yourself. its shown through jennifer and needy's relationship in jennifer's body, which i hadn't thought about but one of the essays in this zine explains it so well. it's shown through when readers see too much of themselves in certain characters. this feeling of discomfort exists both in and out of the texts we talk about. and how this sort of leads into the understanding that yuri is <i>"the relationship to absence, to projection."</i> the yuri that of inside mari is how she <i>absents herself</i> as a way to <i>allow herself</i> to love Yori (to love girls in general). (i want to emphasize how in allowing herself, it implying the norm for her was denying herself, stopping herself, punishing herself for feeling the way she did) because the whole time, the mari we see is just mari the whole time. not komori body swapped into mari's body. <i>the mind warping mental gymnastics she goes through to live this sort of delusion allows her to be a boy who's just trapped in a girl's body. it allows her own self to love girls and accept this because. it's not mari thinking these things, it's komori who is a boy so. it's allowed.</i> this also speaks to <a class="bloglink" href="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*UnCGDPmoKa926HyIuySLBA.png" target="_blank">Shuzo Oshimi&rsquo;s thoughts on being a girl</a>. the ways mari goes about identifying her self while at the same time struggling with the mere act of Looking at her self is so yuri. i'm going to come back to this after i talk about Identity for a little bit hold on.</p>
    <strong>what is it that mari yearns for? what is it about gender?</strong>
    <p>mari's fragmented identity splits into three parts: fumiko, mari, and komori. her attachment to komori, the male identity she takes on stems from her hetero-patriarchal understanding of the world. she envies him for being able to experience sexuality and love girls in ways she feels she can't. but she ultimately abandons this identity too and exists as something separate from all three. or something that combines them all? the story ends with her alive and finally happy with herself. her attachment to komori's identity is less about his masculinity or maleness so to speak, but what she really desires is to love other girls in the specific (romantic, sexual) way he is allowed to in this society. her yearning is lesbian. i read her experience playing with gender not as her struggling with her own gender identity, but instead i felt that her beef was with the social performance of it all. i think she's a girl who doesn't feel connected to the daily practices and rituals that signal femininity. explaining why she sort of.. forgets how to do makeup and dress herself when she exists as the clueless komori inside mari's body.<i> she uses him</i> to liberate herself from these expectations. maybe i'm just full of shit. maybe her gender is just lesbian after all. another essay in the yuri zine talks about how yearning is gay. yearning is queer and yearning is lesbian. that yearning isn't limited to wanting to be with someone, but wanting to be someone. <i>to live life the way they do.</i> which hey. is literally what mari ends up doing in this story. what she yearns for is a reality that cannot exist (or rather, one that she cannot confront/reconcile with yet) she cannot look at herself, so she absents herself in order to allow herself to pursue her own desire. she felt like she couldn't pursue her desire in her current self, in her current standing as a girl in society.</p>
    <strong>what does it mean to feel like a person? to feel human?</strong>
    <p>i need to watch that interview everyone talks about "yuri made me human" because i already feel that truth in my core but i don't even know what the hell they're talking about in that interview. from the zine,<i> "is the fantasy of yuri about finding a way to become a person. when you don't feel like one?"</i> yes. but. what does it mean to feel like a person? in mari's case, which person? her First person? the one that died with her grandmother and replaced with a new name and identity by a mother she cannot understand or bond with? her Second person? mari? the person she grows to hate? <i>the one that is forced to perform these ritualistic practices that signal femininity but is never allowed to desire it for herself? </i>her Third person? komori? the depressed pathetic sexually frustrated hikikomori who is too stupid to see how good he has it* that he doesn't have to fend off boys who only objectify her? that he can have a girlfriend and kiss her and hold her hand in public without punishment? the komori that ultimately broke under the heavy weight of the truth that is not her. she is not him. she is no one for a while. yuri is everything and yuri is nothing. in fact, when mari is in that coma or whatever, yori desperately wants her back again, wants her awake, and she begs <i>"don't disappear"</i> until she wakes up into someone again. someone for yori. but most importantly, someone for herself (the first time i read this, i felt sort of disappointed? that yori and mari didn't get to live together forever but those feelings didn't last long... i don't actually want that for them. in fact i actually really love that they were able to reconcile their feelings for each other and also end on a note where yori goes to school and mari seems to actually be happy and secure with her own self) anyways. she struggles to connect to her fractured identities until through her growth as a character she not only starts <i>feeling </i>like a person but <i>becoming</i> one, probably for the first time.</p>
    <p>inside mari is fascinating to look at and unpack from a yuri pov. i loved thinking about how <b>this too was yuri</b>, that she envies komori for his ability to pursue and love women. the way she <i>projected</i> onto him. the way she wanted something <i>nonexistent</i> and <i>intangible</i>. the way she yearned through imagining she existed as something other than herself. the way she shattered when faced with herself. the way she existed not as a participant, nor an observer. the way she loved yori so much she became everyone and no one.</p>
    <p><b>in conclusion</b> please read yuri zine and please also read yaoi zine 1 and 2 they are genuinely so good. bless the minds of everyone who worked on these.. the yaoi yuri theorists i look up to.... there's no real conclusion to this ramble i hate conclusions. i'm done. i know this isn't my usual journal entry post i just needed to write about my feelings on this. good night...</p>

<div class=content>
<p><img src=https://media.tenor.com/Ol_47KKlAM4AAAAj/nichijou-yuuko.gif style=float:left;width:160px;padding-left:10px>it is six in the morning and i haven't slept yet!! except this time it's all my fault. i am suffering the consequences of my poor choices (drinking a boatload of coffee and taking my boosters at 9pm). sue me for wanting to play video games as a reward for teaching myself calculus for 6 hours straight today... </p>
<p>also i just wanted to note that i LIED in my last blog post. i made the move. my site is now hosted on neocities hell yea. still getting used to it and it feels weird having it post updates every time i make changes to this site, which is like nearly every day? i feel so deranged looking at the number of updates lmfao. but it's nice #community.</p>
<p>i realize now i should definetly be calling this a 'diary' and not a blog. i'll get around to that eventually. i have so many plans for this site that i keep on a List but.. school.. and Work.... take up so much time. there are just not enough hours of the day.... why do we need to sleep in the first place?? there is too much art to consume and talk about and engage with for me to 'go to sleep'... this is a constant struggle of mine. yes i know that a couple months ago i was feeling the exact opposite and that i wanted to be asleep for a week straight. both of those truths coexist. i contain multitudes.</p>
<p><img src=images/blog-posts/2024/DRAWME1707044465194.png style=height:120px;float:right;padding-left:10px>this doodle submission made me grin from ear to ear. i save them all to my computer, but i wonder if i should make a home for them on here as well? i look thru them whenever i want to smile they bring me lots of joy...</p>

<div class=content>
<p><img src=images/blog-posts/2024/idiot.gif style=float:right;width:160px;padding-left:10px>love how the very next thing that happens after my website's first birthday was sudden DEATH. my domain expired and i forgot to turn on the auto-renew.. scary moment. it's all fixed now. we're back in business. i've been keeping my media log entries in my phone notes app until i figured out how to get this site up and running again...</p>
<p>i almost used this as an excuse to switch to neocities, because i feel like. i would like to interact with other neocities people more. cause they're cool. but then i remembered the reason why i made this site in the first place was so i could do what i wanted without the need for external pressures or validation. so i will not be doing that. instead i will just keep existing as i am and if somebody happens to stumble upon this humble e-bode i have.. that is So cool and great. a lovely coincidence. enjoy your time here. you know? anyways, i've had some ideas for stuff to add to my site later:</p>
<ul>
<li>greener grass shrine that's structured like those crazy conspiracy pin boards. take images from the movie that i connect with red string, and then when you hover over each image you can read a blurb about what that scene means..</li>
<li>i've gotta update the bird zone and podcast shrine soon...</li>
<li>figure out how to filter media log by certain tags: year, type of media... it's also due for a makeover i don't like how it looks anymore</li>

<div class=content>
<p>it's been a full 365 days of sabrin.party!!! woah! crazy to think about how when i first made this site, i was very unsure if i'd end up sticking with it at all. so this milestone is huge! i am so proud of how far this silly little hobby has come. though i haven't actually accomplished much, i like being able to look back at my own thoughts and blogs and media log entries. i think it's so cool that sabrin.party exists. and i'm very happy with myself for creating it.</p>
<img style=float:right;width:140px;padding-left:10px src=images/blog-posts/2024/birthday.gif><p>winter break is soon coming to an end, so i'm sure i'll be way more active on here once the semester starts and i'm back to my usual stressing. over break i've been mostly watching an absurd amount of god awful movies, which i've been logging in my media log thing. i cherish that part of my site. i want to figure out a way to have some sort of tagging or filtering system on there? i planned to work on that over break but never got around to it. i feel like i should be able to know how to do that.. i just took a java course so it would be nice if i could actually put those skills to use, i guess.</p>
<p>anyways. happy one year to sabrinparty. i wonder if i'll make it to 2...</p>

<div class=content>
<p>hello internet. i survived finals week! that was the worst finals season of my life. i pray i never go through that again... i am still recovering from being Sick with Stress. but i'm just glad i made it.</p>
<p>after my initial period of recovery i've sort of just been taking it easy these past few weeks. i only just started Emerging from my Enclosure and socializing with my friends again. i've missed my friends. i saw <strong>the urban nutcracker</strong> with my friend last week. it was fun! we still don't know what the plot is. our plan is to watch every version of the nutcracker out there and save the plain old regular ballet <img src="images/blog-posts/2023/not the rat king.png" style=float:left;padding-right:10px;padding-top:10px;width:160px> for last. last year we saw The Nutcracker Experience (a light show), this year was the urban nutcracker, next year... the slutcracker? if we can't figure out the plot of the nutcracker by the last showing, then we shall forever live with our ignorance on the matter. i will never look it up. either i get it or i don't. it was really fun dressing up in color coordinated outfits and getting complimented by strangers.</p>
<p>perks of being on break: mental wellness. no stress. less time on twitter. cons of being on break: nocturnal sleeping habits come back. i've been playing lots of games recently. lots of warframe and baldur's gate. i'm a sucker for story driven games. hence why this blog isn't very interesting. just wanted to check in. gonna go game now. byeeeee xo</p>

<button type=button class=collapsible><time>2023-12-03</time>: fashioned by sargent exhibit thoughts</button>
<div class=content>
<p>i went to the mfa last friday because i was required to take a selfie with some statue for my art history final. i also realized i could go to the Fashioned by Sargent exhibit, which i've actually been meaning to go to for so long, but haven't because school has been keeping me so busy. so i decided to kill two birds with one stone. i honestly expected this experience to go as my usual trips to the museum. but alas, the adhd demons have struck again. although i am reluctant to give credit to the french in any way, i was charmed by this john singer sargent lad... he took full creative control over every aspect of the portraits he painted. he decided the dresses, the background and location, the poses, <i>everything</i> was chosen and designed by him. i haven't stopped thinking about his portraits all day and i've decided to stop yapping at all my friends about this fuck ass french painter and write about it here instead...</p>

<p style=margin-top:-4px><strong><i>Mrs. Hugh Hammersley</i></strong>'s portrait (1892) was one of my favorite portraits i saw yesterday. i was first really drawn to the color of the dress she was wearing, and did a double take take because the way he rendered the velvety silk fabric of the dress was honestly.. i don't even know how to adequately put it into words i was starstruck. it was the first time i've seen such care put into painting fabric like this. what's really fun is that sargent sent mrs hammersley a scrap <img src=images/blog-posts/2023/hammersley_card.png style=float:right;padding-left:10px;padding-top:5px;width:140px>from the dress she wore along with a cute note that says "part of the gown in which my beloved sister, w. hugh hammersley, sat to john sargent" as a souvenir. i thought that was really sweet and reading that made me really fond of this portrait.</p>
<a href=https://www.dailyartmagazine.com/lady-agnew-john-singer-sargent/ target=_blank><img src=/images/blog-posts/2023/agnew.png style=width:180px;float:right;padding-left:10px></a><p style=margin-top:-4px>the <strong><i>Lady Agnew of Lochnaw</i></strong> (1892) was another portrait i really fell in love with. the first thing i noticed was how comfortable and casual her pose was. and i found her gaze to be particularly striking... i think the first thought i had when i saw this was that tweet that went like "she looks like she's trying to attract women" which is a very silly thought to have when looking at fine art but it's true. she does. i don't know much about fine art or portraits from this era but i've never seen this energy depicted in portraits like this before. it really stood out to me. the wall text said that miss agnew had the flu when she was sitting for this portrait, and for some reason this small bit of context made me love this portrait even more. also, i wish i looked this good sick with the flu...</p>
<a href=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/21453 target=_blank><img src=images/blog-posts/2023/carmencita_dress.png style=width:180px;float:left;padding-right:10px></a><p>overall, the coolest thing about this exhibit was how they brought in the same dresses that were in a lot of the portraits to show side by side. my favorite dress they had on display was the one worn for <strong><i>La Carmencita</i></strong>'s portrait (1890). the overlay of the mesh fabrics and the embroidered design reminded me a lot of moroccan kaftans. apparently, she was a very restless sitter, which is funny because her portrait is, as all of sargant's portrats, stationary. lots of classist folk were not too happy with sargent for painting her, but he seems like the kind of guy who did not give a fuck. there were a lot more dresses and portraits side by side that i really loved, but i did not take as many photos as i had wanted to. too busy experiencing the exhibit with Awe. i already want to go back...</p>
<a href=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/644345 target=_blank><img src=/images/blog-posts/2023/pozzi.png style=width:180px;float:right;padding-left:10px></a> <p>there were also a lot of male portraits shown at the exhibit, but only two really caught my eye. the first one, <strong><i>Dr. Pozzi at Home</i></strong> (1881) was really striking.. he just looks soooo cozy here with the velvet curtains in the back i am a big fan. apparently this guys was a gynecologist so props to him for knowing how pussy works. my favorite part of the wall text was that he was often described by the men around him as exceptionally beautiful. and that sargent was really charmed by dr. pozzi as well.. which was kind of obvious based off the energy coming from this portrait..</p>
<a href=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/633189 target=_blank><img src=/images/blog-posts/2023/deering.png style=width:180px;float:left;padding-right:10px></a><p>the other guy portrait i really liked was his <strong><i> Portrait of Charles Deering </i></strong> (1917) who was one of sargent's lifelong besties. some crazy business man on vacation in florida... i was really charmed by his outfit. the off-white suit, the straw hat, his white shows while surrounded by palm trees is just such a lovely image. i appreciate the calm soothing energies radiating off this portrait. and i know this is the jjk brainrot speaking but this also made me think of nanami kento... this is what he should have been doing.... what he deserved.. missing him..</p>
<p>the exibit is still open until the 15th of january.. i really want to go again. maybe next month i'll even buy the art book if i am still as obsessed with these portraits as i am right now. now i have to go study for my compsci exam. finals season has been really beating my ass this semester. i considered #blogging about it but i don't wanna bring my emo-ness onto here.. its such a lovely place, my website... keep it nice and good vibes and stuff. hope you enjoyed my ramblings on my favorite sargent paintings i will probably do this again..</p>

<button type=button class=collapsible><time>2023-11-08</time>: i think i'm being cursed by a fictional character</button>
<div class=content>
<img src=images/blog-posts/2023/knives.png style=float:left;padding-right:10px;padding-top:25px;width:160px> <p>alright this is going to sound very silly but i just need to write this down. i think i am being cursed by millions knives the fictional character from trigun. that would be a great reddit post title if i had a reddit account tbh. to start off i need to give u a rundown of my trigun merch and other fan stuff purchases so you can Understand the full story.</p>
<p>last summer i bought a knives plushie and Only a knives plushie because i was too broke to buy all three (vash and wolfwood) at the same time. but apparently not too broke to also buy a knives, wolfwood, and vash keychain, and also a knives bottle cap pin (all these except the plushie are from <a href=https://cranity.bigcartel.com/ target=_blank style=background-color:#7f75f6>cranity shop</a> btw check them out they're one of my favorite artists Very cool). anyways the point is that's a lot of stuff but i got one of Each character because i wanted all of them. to be together. and live together as a fucked up family on my keychain thingy, right? so here's where it gets funny.</p>
<p>i get the plushie in september. amazing. couple weeks later i get 1 of 2 packages with the keychains, i got my knives keychain! great amazing so exciting. i put him on my jeans. so now i have a count of 2: knives merch. couple weeks later i get part 2 of 2 of my package so naturally im expecting the vash wolfwood and knives pin. <strong>however!</strong> there was a silly mixup with the packages and i open the envelope to see.. a knives keychain. identical to the one i have! so i'm like omg that is so funny. i have.. 2 knives know. 3 total technically. and no vashwood no pin. so i email the lovely shop owner and they're like oopsies! sorry for the mixup ill send ur stuff next week and they did! great amazing. the package comes and IT'S JUST THE KNIVES PIN. SO NOW I HAVE SO MUCH KNIVES MERCH AND NO OTHER TRIGUN CHARACTER MERCH. and i just want to be clear i'm not complaining at all i literally love this artist and am so grateful they have their stuff up for sale i just think this string of mixups and miscommunications is absolutely hilarious</p>
<p>so my theory is... knives may have manifested himself into reality and is using his cursed evil territorial vibes to sabotage my trigun purchase orders and manipulate them somehow so that the only thing that enters my house is knives. it's the only valid explanation for this silly series of events. what else could it possibly be? why is it that the knives always make it to my home safe and sound but vash and wolfwood are not allowed. it is clear to me that knives has marked my home as his territory and that obviously i'm not allowed to love anyone else except for him. so that's where i'm at now. another piece of supporting evidence for this i forgot to add is that when i got my first knives keychain i wore him once and then the next day i forgot to bring him out with me and that was the Worst day i had in months. it wasn't that deep but just a series of miserable unimportant events: coffee order somehow didn't go through and i had to wait 30 minutes to make me another one. was late to class. i had a quiz i forgot about and didn't prepare for. my stomach growled so loud in class the girl next to me Turned Around and Looked At Me like i did something wrong. the train broke down on my way home. i just felt like knives was punishing me for leaving me home. so now he's on my keychain permanently and i never take him off. he has grown attached to me now and there's nothing i can do about it. i just wish he'd let me let other trigun guys into my home to keep him company... or something..</p>
<p>anyways this is ridiculous i just wanted to share... i hope you can find some enjoyment from this...</p>

<div class=content>
<img src=https://99gifshop.neocities.org/items/5/octglobe.gif style=float:left;padding-right:10px;padding-top:5px;height:140px><p>good god. it is october. too many events have happened all at once and i am very overwhelmed grr. i am blogging in the middle of this silly ass tourism class to try to uh de-stress and maybe feel normal about things. reading the secret history made me realize how much i love learning things at school. being in my soc classes depresses me. being in my compsci classes is Definitely a challenge but i don't think i can actually get good at it, which also depresses me. maybe i should have just majored in literature after all... i just can't seem to stick to One thing! a very silly (and expensive...) flaw of mine.</p>
<p>i also feel weird about not having updated this site in a while. it's my precious baby. i've just been so tired lately. i haven't been doing as well in school as i'd like because i keep getting interrupted by Life Events. so i get all frazzled and it takes me like, an entire week to recover. so the semester has been off to a rough start.</p>
<img src=images/blog-posts/2023/tav.png style=float:right;padding-left:10px;padding-top:5px;height:170px><p>on the bright side i started playing baldur's gate 3, which is a very different kind of game than what i typically play, but i actually really like it. i'm still not used to the mechanics and gameplay yet, but i'm really invested in the lore and the storyline. plus i had a lot of fun making my main character oc. i think i made him too pretty though... i had originally went in with the plan of making a very big creature looking man with an underbite and stuff, but i got distracted and ended up with something completely different. i love how realistic the game is, i can see their pores! crazy. the pale elf is fun, and he seems to be a #FanFavorite, i see that guy all over twitter. i hope the alien lady from the very beginning comes back, she was cool and i miss her.</p>
<p>okay class is over now i am ending this blog. farewell.</p>

<button type=button class=collapsible><time>2023-09-03</time>: head full so many thoughts...</button>
<div class=content>
<p>it's funny, i've noticed a strong correlation between my creativity levels and my stress levels. as soon as i start stressing out about something (ahem, school) i start thinking genius thoughts and creating so much Art (in the most untraditional sense). i'm not <a target=_blank href=images/blog-posts/2023/injuries.png><img src=images/blog-posts/2023/injuries-dithered.png style=width:150px;float:left;padding-right:10px;padding-top:10px></a>really looking forward to school, despite Loving school a lot. i'm just really nervous to start again. so for the past few days i've been thinking a lot about how the trans experience is represented in movies and tv shows.</p>
<p>i made my first ever zine (on canva... i didn't have the materials i wanted to make it by hand which was what i had originally wanted to do)! it's basically a character study on wolfwood and i used him to think about the connection between the body horror genre and transness. you can read it <a style=color:#7f75f6 target=_blank href=https://t.co/e7Z8REjvsd>here</a>, but i think i want to find a home for it on my website too. later. the page i'm most proud of is the one on injuries. i feel like i articulated those thoughts the best. you can click on that image to view in full quality.</p>
<p>since then i've been on a roll of consuming media with very similar themes. i watched The Fly (1986) which was a very fun way of exploring gender through body horror. and now i'm re-watching BNA with my friend lola. i had first watched this anime in 2020, so i remember literally nothing. it's perfect because it feels like i'm watching it for the first time all over again. during this watch i was really struck by the transgender themes, especially in episode 4 that centers nina and our main girl michiru. the entire episode basically tells the story of two closeted trans kids sneaking out to a party where they seek acceptance, get to explore their gender the way they want to for the first time, are met with hostility, and come back home with no regrets.</p>
<p><img src=/images/blog-posts/2023/nina1.png style=float:right;padding-left:10px;width:190px>nina is introduced as this dolphin girl who's totally obsessed with being a human and "passing" as one. she's an internet celebrity and tells everyone online that she's a human. online, she can actually control the way people perceive her and gets to exist in the identity she chooses! the one she feels she belongs to! michiru also has a lot of Body Struggles existing as a beastman when all she wants is to go back to being a human too. she's unhappy with her body and doesn't feel like it belongs to her. so once she realizes she can look human again on command, she and nina sneak out (without permission) to go to a party where nina is told she will be accepted. there, nina fully embraces what it's like to exist as a human. even tho michiru is still so hesitant and terrified and anxious and not ready to Come Out. and this party is so fascinating because everyone there puts up <img src=images/blog-posts/2023/nina2.png style=width:200px;float:left;padding-right:10px;padding-top:10px> this facade of #allyship and nina gets so caught up in the excitement she accidentally turns back into a dolphin in front of everyone. the partygoers then start to parade her around like she's a shiny new toy creature and from that point onwards they only see her as a dolphin. it's like even when cis people get your pronouns and name right, you can tell when they don't really see you as your true identity. they still subscribe to the gender structures you're trying so hard to break out of. the partygoers just put nina back in this <s>box</s> (fish tank) she never wanted to be in, and it really sucks. nina gets hurt, michiru takes her home, and talks about regretting going to the party. to this, nina melts my heart and tells her that even though their night out didn't go as planned, and even though she was hurt and it was hard, she still loved her time there. she still loved being a human because that's who she really is! it was such a beautiful moment and so explicitly queer.</p>
<p>do you see how all of these thoughts come to me at 4 in the morning when i'm supposed to be sleeping, fixing my sleep schedule, and preparing for classes. do you see how these thoughts plague my mind during the most inconvenient of times. do you see how i struggle with these huge massive juicy brilliant brain babies that come to me during the wee hours of the night when i have other babies to tend to.</p>

<div class=content>
<p>i've officially settled from my summer trip to morocco! that was fun. i am glad to be back. i missed seeing my friends. and watching tv! and good iced coffee. emphasis on the last one.</p>
<img src=/images/blog-posts/2023/meatloaf.png style=width:180px;float:left;padding-right:10px><p>despite being ultra mega broke right now, i got very bored yesterday and went on a walk to the coffee shop and bookstore, and stopped by goodwill to check out their music collection. it hit me that i have a whole ass CD player, and thrift stores would surely have a neat collection of music for me to check out. so i went! i found meat loaf's welcome to the neighborhood. i've only listened to a few of their songs here and there and really liked them, so i picked it up to listen when i got home. i really like it! very meat loaf. and the album cover is wicked cool. i currently have it playing on repeat until i get sick of it completely.</p>
<p>i'm not mentally prepared to go back to school, but i still have a couple weeks before we start. i am most looking forward to having a job again. i went a little crazy with the summer spending this year... lots to pay back. but everything will be fine if i don't stress about it too much. peace and love, or whatever that trigun guy says..</p>

<button type=button class=collapsible><time>2023-07-23</time>: trip to the mountains!</button>
<div class=content>
<p>after three years of begging my mom to take me up to the mountains of morocco where she's from, my dream finally came true! <img src=images/blog-posts/2023/mountains1.png style=float:left;padding-right:10px;width:180px;padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px>we spent two days there and it was by far the highlight of my summer. we arrived at around 9am and had breakfast, and i met a lot of my mom's cousins and their kids and they are all such wonderful people. they were really surprised i could speak arabic and that i was so happy to be there. i just love the countryside. it's rare i get to experience it. after breakfast we all went out and explored their land to see what they grew over there. most of it was olive trees but i was nibbling from all of the fruit trees i could reach. they had carob trees, i ate figs, blackberries, pomegranates, oranges, lemons, watermelons, squash, and others i am probably forgetting. after that we went back home and had lunch <img src=images/blog-posts/2023/bunnies.png style=float:right;padding-top:10px;padding-left:10px;padding-bottom:10px;width:180px>and one of my cousins found some bunnies and showed them to us! they were so cute. i loved hearing about all the plants they grow there and the animals they take care of. i wish i had that kind of knowledge on the life that surrounds us. i'm tired of being a city slicker. we spent the night hanging out with my mom's family and talking to them about all sorts of things. i got a huge ego boost because of how impressed they were of me, which is pretty funny.<img src=images/blog-posts/2023/mountains3.png style=width:180px;float:left;padding-right:10px;width:170px;padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px> the bar is so low when it comes to moroccans who grew up outside of morocco that they were really surprised that i was actually able to hold a conversation! the next day i woke up at 5am (the roosters and dogs barking were really loud, but it didn't really bother me much. it was like a Natural Alarm Clock) and we all went on a long hike all the way to the top of the mountain they live on. i had so much fun i've never been happier. we ate all sorts of berries on the way (mostly blackberries which i don't even like much, but they were so yummy!). i came across this skull. i forget what creature left it here. most likely either a horse or a cow, i remember asking but i forgot the answer. it shall remain a mystery. i think the hike took a total of 2 hours up and down. it was wonderful. my mom's aunt gave me a headscarf and a 'mendil' so i looked very rural. after the hike we finally had breakfast at around 11am i think. and i took a fat nap. i woke up just in time for lunch and we had cous-cous!<img src=/images/blog-posts/2023/mountains4.png style=width:220px;float:right;padding-top:10px;padding-left:10px;padding-bottom:10px> which also makes me really sleepy so i took another short nap. after that i went down to the well and filled up jugs of water for the family, and the water was so delicious. if you think water can't be yummy you're wrong. after that we had dinner and spent the rest of the night telling each other riddles (which i could not figure out for the life of me...) and chatting. it was really nice and i loved the time i spent there. i plan on visiting the mountains every time i come to morocco from now on. i love it so much! that's all for my summer updates... </p>
<p>on an unrelated note, i really wanted to see Barbenheimer at the movies but i doubt they'll still be in theaters by the time i come back home. i could technically watch them while i'm here but i did not pack my barbie outfit... and who would i be if i didn't go see barbie in my pretty pink outfit. not myself, that's for sure. even if i don't see them in theaters, i have plans to watch them both at home with my dearest miraç (≧◡≦) ♡ so i'll be looking forward to that.</p>

<div class=content>
<p><img src=/images/blog-posts/2023/tangier1.png style=width:200px;float:right;padding-left:10px> figured i'd blog a little bit about morocco while i finally have some downtime. i've been so busy the past week it's been hard to find some time to recharge... after celebrating eid with my family (which was lots of fun) my cousins and i went to tangier for the weekend! we first went to this beautiful place (i don't remember what it's called.. and i forgot to ask) but the views were incredible. we then took a short walk up the Rmilat, where my cousins spotted some famous Instagram vlogger. it makes sense, it's such a nice spot. i've been to the Rmilat once before on our last trip for my sister's birthday. later that night we went to this Club (except it wasn't a club in the traditional sense of the word...)<img src=/images/blog-posts/2023/tangier2.png style=width:180px;float:left;padding-right:10px;padding-top:10px> i thought it would be a Club Club, but it was actually just a nice sit-down restaurant. with some dancing towards the end. I was way too shy to dance (felt very out of my element) but it was so much fun! the food was delicious I had 4 of those mini quesadillas and a virgin mojito. mojitos seem to be all the rage this summer in Morocco (they even have them in McDonalds?) they're not even that good...</p>
<p><img src=/images/blog-posts/2023/asilah1.png style=width:180px;float:right;padding-left:10px>after the tangier trip we stopped by Asilah on the way back home to my grandmother's house. oh to live in one of those gorgeous neighborhoods. walking down the streets of Asilah will never get old, it's so beautiful. there's so much art around and i wanted to buy All Of It So Bad...... but I did not have any money... so sad. I'm grateful I got to enjoy it all in the first place. except, at this point in the trip i was so exhausted i could barely stand on my two feet anymore... I hope to visit again soon when I'm not so tired and achey, since it's not too far from where I'm staying.</p>
<p>after the tangier/asilah trip, i entered my beach bum era! i told my cousins i wanted to have a beach bum summer and it's been going well so far. i wish i could embrace the beach bum life back home but there's just no good beaches near massachusetts. that don't <img src=/images/blog-posts/2023/beach1.png style=width:140px;float:left;padding-right:10px;padding-top:10px>cost a bajillion dollars to get to. moroccan beaches are superior anyways. i went to kahf lhmam two days in a row and it was great. i got a little burnt for the first time! it doesn't hurt but i'm red all over. i guess they weren't kidding when they said the UV would be at 11 those days... it was intense! i loved swimming at the beach i'm itching to go again. there's nothing better than that special kind of Beach Hunger and the Post-Beach Sleep..... after day 1 of Beach i slept for 13 hours... i was so tired. on day 2 i went into the mountains on that beach and scooped up some algae clay and put it all over my face and chest and arms as a clay mask. it made my skin so soft.. hope you enjoyed reading my Highlights i hope they were coherent. i'm re-watching trigun stampede as i write this so.. hehe</p>

<p><img src=/images/blog-posts/2023/aybee.jpg style=float:right;width:200px;padding-left:10px;padding-bottom:10px>my beloved friend <span style=background-color:#7f75f6;font-weight:bold;color:#efeffe>adia</span> came into town to visit me today and i had the best day ever!! it was very rainy and we got soaked but i'm still so glad they came despite the poor weather. we had brunch at the friendly toast downtown and i had yummy scrambled eggs and adia had a fancy looking eggs benedict. she explained what an egg benedict was but i still don't understand it. it looked yummy though. we also did some indoor activities (shopping) at newbury comics and bought miles morales merch and i bought the new ateez album. the serotonin boost was going off the charts for both of us.. we unboxed all of our purchases immediately outside of the store. there was no time to wait. naturally.</p>
<p>after that we hung around the harbor and made up stories about how bostonian children get christened in the water where they did the boston tea party back in 1772. and i took that photo of my friend because their jacket matched the boat in the back and it was cute.</p>
<p>as i am typing this i just realized we never made it to the juneteenth celebration we were supposed to go to... i actually just facepalmed so hard. going to text this to them later. wow. that's the only downside to this trip i can't believe we forgot. well... we'll gettem next time! other than that, i am actually so happy i got to see them today and i had so much fun and i miss them already. i love adia! i can't wait for the next time we hang out (in person) ☆⌒ヽ(*'､^*)chu</p>

<div class=content>
<p>god i love art. i love buying art. i'm broke as shit but i love deluding myself into thinking i'm a rich old lady patron of the arts. i went to the brighton bazaar today and had such a fun time looking at all the artists selling their work.<img style=float:right;padding-top:10px;padding-left:10px;padding-bottom:10px;width:160px src=/images/blog-posts/2023/retromania.png> i got a retromania poster, which i hope to go to next year. they have updates on when they host events like these on Instagram which i don't have anymore so.... i rely on my lovely friends to keep me updated on things like these now. i keep thinking everyone else stopped using Instagram when i did, so I'm always surprised when people ask me to follow theirs.... i really do Not want to go back to instagram but i might make a throwaway account just so i can get notifications for local events and stuff? if i don't figure out another way to be In The Know about these things... there has to be other ways... <img style=float:left;padding-top:10px;padding-right:10px;padding-bottom:10px;height:160px src=/images/blog-posts/2023/mourningdoves.png></p>
<p>i bought this beautiful little buglady print that i jumped on as soon as i saw it because it reminded me of my favorite jujutsu kaisen lady, yorozu ♡ from @mourningdoves (on instagram). i also got a cicada pin from <a href=https://www.rovinghouse.com/>the roving house</a> and the beautiful 'sixties radnitzky' button from <a href=https://www.marianneradnitzky.com/>Marianne Radnitsky</a> and a snake ring from a woman who's name i forgot to grab before i left and feel so bad about.... kicking myself for the rest of eternity over this.... im sorry snake ring lady i<img style=float:right;padding-top:10px;padding-left:10px;padding-bottom:10px;width:160px src=/images/blog-posts/2023/girlslove.png> was too distracted talking to you that i forget to grab a business card to remember you by...</p>
<p>i had a great time today and i will Totally be coming to every one of these events now that I know they have them pretty often... the next one is in June i believe and i really want to get a couple t-shirts.</p>
<p>on another note i've been wanting to do yet another complete redesign of my website... i want a lighter theme that feels more 2007 web design with like fake ads and stuff... but keep the omori references on every page. i have some ideas i hope to get around to this summer. i'm off to binge the rest of succession now..... farewell</p>

<p>this is the longest i've gone without updating my site in a while, i'm pretty sure. at least, it sure feels like it. I am so completely utterly burnt out. Checked out. mentally Done with the semesters but i have a very difficult final coming up in 2 days and. have given up on studying for it. i've never had a burnout this bad before like..... wow i am just so done with school. i'll officially be Free! on friday night. then i'll be able to sleep for 3 days straight and then come back and start working on this site a little more. thinking of a complete redesign again. perhaps i should preserve all my old layouts somehow. <i>finals week or my final week?! stay tuned...</i></p>

<button type=button class=collapsible><time>2023-04-02</time>: my (late) birthday blog</button>
<div class=content>
<p>i had originally meant to write this on my actual birthday, which was yesterday. happy birthday me!! i am The April Fool. since it's ramadan, i didn't really get to do any of the usual birthday celebrations (fasting makes me soo <img style=padding-right:8px;padding-top:8px;float:left;height:140px src=/images/blog-posts/2023/sunnyfinalboss.gif>sleepy anyhow) so i'm just going to do a small birthday celebration with friends after eid ♡ yesterday i got my nails done at the salon because i hadn't been in a while.. i got <span style=color:red>red</span> this time! i spent the rest of the day wandering around the grocery store Hungrily and then came home to watch tv and play omori with my friend ab ('▽^人) we finally finished the sunny route! i cried during the final battle & the final duet cutscene... it really is such a beautiful game.</p>
<p>well.. i messed up my sleep and meds schedule last night due to Important Gaming things which actually renders me completely useless for the day. sometimes i wish i had the Hyperactive part of adhd in me so at the very least i can get up and do stuff... however the ADD and the Fatigue demons r winning the battle of today. my brain feels foggy and extremely sleepy but i also am not Sleepy.. if that makes <img src=/images/blog-posts/2023/sakura.gif style=float:right;padding:8px;padding-bottom:0;width:100px>sense at all. this is unfortunate because i have two big assignments due in 2 days which is stressing my out a little bit... computer science is hard. (⇀‸↼‶) so i will spend today doing Absolutely nothing but rot in my bed and tomorrow i'll just have to grind extra hard...</p>

<div class=content>
<p>personally i think it should be a crime that spring break only lasts a week. it all went by so fast! this week my friends from out of state and i got to spend a few days together over spring break and i had so much fun! we went to the aquarium and i made lots of sea creature friends, it was really nice. we also saw two museums and went to this super cute crafts place where we made hair clips and phone cases, and i really want to go back soon to make a rug because that looked really fun. i also had some of the tastiest ramen and the tastiest nigerian food i've ever had in my life. man i love good food. here are some photos i took during our trip!</p>

<p>besides these adventures i'm also super close to finishing my third full play-through of OMORI with my friend (we just entered blackspace, aaah!) and i am super excited to see how they will play out the ending. i love that game so much and it's so much fun sharing the OMORI experience with a friend too. i'm glad i got to make the most of my spring break, i totally wasn't expecting all this excitement! i am very much dreading the start of school again on monday... i have so much to work on. sunday will be crunch time... well. off i go!</p>

<div class=content>
<p>jennette mccurdy?! at MY school?! it's more likely than you'd think. last Friday the one and only jennette mcCurdy came to my campus to talk about her book and i had no idea this event was happening until literally 2 hours before. i battled <img src=/images/blog-posts/2023/jmbook.png style=float:left;padding-right:10px;padding-top:10px;height:200px> many demons and the will of gods in order to make it in time to see her and i'm so glad i did. i bought her book & audio cd as i was sitting there looking at her and watching her talk. it was surreal. jennette was sooo inspiring to me it was incredible to hear her talk ab her one woman show and her book and also her future plans! she's so funny and also.. maybe a little tooo relatable at times. i can't wait for my book to come to i can read it and maybe blog about it later. just wanted to document this highlight of not only my year, but my LIFE! i'll be thinking about this day forever... and if you're reading this. go buy I'm Glad My Mom Died by jennette mccurdy from your local bookstore i know you have one..</p>

<button type=button class=collapsible><time>2023-01-22</time>: daily blog: puss in boots!!!!</button>
<div class=content>
<p>hello! i'm having a lot of fun learning how to animate images. although it's really really hard. anywho. its the last day of ~freedom~ before my semester starts tomorrow, and i am really nervous about my upcoming calculus and computer science classes.</p>
<p>i am not really a math person, and i added this computer science degree to my course load because i wanted a challenge (and i don't want to be poor!) ..・ヾ(。＞＜)シ but i know i can do well! i know once i start classes tomorrow i will feel better.</p>
<p>this post is doubling as a movie review for <strong>puss in boots: the last wish</strong>. i saw this yesterday with my friend and we LOVED it. this was so surprisingly good i am comfortable calling it the most best Movie ever.</p>
<p>i've never seen the previous movies so i didn't really know what to expect. the first / intro song <a style=background-color:hotpink;color:yellow href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8EAdlxwsq8">"fearless hero"</a> is such a bop it's been stuck in head since i watched it. i loved everything about that movie it's hard to figure out where to start. i loved the villain of the movie, the Reaper wolf guy. and i love how he wasn't really a bad guy, just absolutely terrifying (nearly pissed myself whenever he showed up) (fun fact: my friend told me during the movie that in some cultures, people bury loved ones with coins atop their eyes and that sort of symbolizes death, hence the coins in wolfie's eyes. i just thought that was really cool). i've never seen a movie like this explore the fear of death, how to deal with these fears and still make sure to keep it light. making movies suitable for both children and adults is an incredible skill! (ᗒᗣᗕ)՞</p>
<p>i am officially a puss in boots Fan after watching this movie. <img src=images/blog-posts/2023/pussinboots1.gif height=100 style=float:left;padding:10px> kitty and puss are so much fun. i really enjoyed their dynamics and their adorable ending together. i'm not much of a romantic but who wouldn't awe at "one life spent with you is all that i could wish for" like come on now. (≧◡≦) ♡</p>
<p>i guess my one critique of the movie was that it would have been better if there were more songs. but that doesn't really carry much weight overall. i think with that intro song i was expecting more songs like a <img src=images/blog-posts/2023/pussinboots2.gif height=100 style=float:right;padding:10px> disney money. and it would have been so good. but despite all that i'd give this movie a 10/10. the animation was incredible, i love how choppy it looked (choppy isn't the right word, but whatever they did gave it a comic-book esque feel and i really loved it)</p><img src=images/blog-posts/2023/divider.gif>
<p>after seeing that masterpiece of a film, me and my friend went to a vegan thai food place nearby. i had fried dumplings, <img src=images/blog-posts/2023/tom-yom-gai-soup.png height=150 style=float:left;padding:10px> wontons (yum), and some tom yum gai soup. every time i try something new here to see what i like. i did not enjoy the soup as much but i think that's just because i don't like water based soup in general. i luv creamy soups. next time i'm in town i think i will try one of their noodle soups. they come in huge bowls, so i will definitely be taking home leftovers. (^人^) that's all i have for today. hope you enjoyed my rambles.</p>

<button type=button class=collapsible><time>2023-01-15</time>: first ever blog post</button>
<div class=content>
<p>i think i'm starting to get a hang of this website building thing? thank you to the internet for being my teacher... it is so late, my head hurts a little and i'm still not tired. i am to blame. once i figure out this whole coding thing and learn how to make stuff fully on my own i will probably have more puter-related things to say. but for my first post? entry... i will practice my list making skills.</p>
<p>that was a lie i won't be doing that yet. first i want to tell you about my day. i went to a <strong>bookstore!!!!!</strong> with my friend and even though i said i would only buy myself two books i could not control my impulses so i bought four. here is a list of the books i bought today:</p>
<ul style=padding-left:25px>
<li><u>folklorn</u> by Angela Hur</li>
<li><u>thistlefoot</u> by GennaRose Nethercott</li>
<li><u>cassandra at the wedding</u> by Dorothy Baker</li>
<li><u>decline and fall</u> by Evelyn Waugh (which uh... i am nervous about ngl)</li></ul>
<p>so that's exciting! here's a picture i took when i got home from my trip. and also a picture of the egg sandwich i had too. it was so delicious. scrambled eggs. avocado. pesto. cheese. tomato. on english muffin. mmmmmm... getting hungry again just thinking about it.</p>
<img src=images/blog-posts/2023/books1.png alt="image of the books i listed stacked on top of each other" height=150> <img src=images/blog-posts/2023/engmuffin1.png alt="image of my yummy english muffin i had today" height=200><p>this is looking like a real blog already wow look at that. until next time!</p>

<p>bunny by mona awad</p>
<img src=/images/library/bunny.png class=cover>
<p>i have mixed feelings about this one. i think. the first hundred pages were a bore, the main character was giving a sort of pathetic girl vibe that i did not find interesting at all, but i pushed through. it really started picking up when the girlcult frakenstein workshops begun and they started making and slaughtering boybunnies. bunnyboys? misshapen deformed works of art. hollow carcases? whatever. and then the main character made the best boybunny of all.. which was actually just a masculinized version of herself who is allowed to love her best friend in ways she feels she cant. her best friend ava who may or may not be a bird. it's very absurd and i really liked the intensity of this part. it took me a while to finish because i couldn't fully be immersed, perhaps the writing style and i aren't that compatible. but i didn't hate it. i liked it. i just didn't love it.</p></div></div></div>

<p>dogtooth (2009)</p>
<img src=/images/library/dogtooth.png class=cover>
<p>this took me a full day to write my entry for this movie. partly because i needed to sit with it but mostly because i had a lot of other work to do.. this movie was so beautiful. i love the faded colors of the greens outside and how naked the inside of their home looks. it gives the entire movie a feeling of uneasiness from the start while at the same time making it all feel like a memory of your own? if that means anything to anyone at all. it’s such good story. man turns his family into a super high controlled group where the kids don’t know about anything that exists outside their home. they do such a good job at writing how these siblings grow up under these strange conditions, like. they all think airplanes are toy planes because they look small when they’re in the air. they have no concept of sexuality whatsoever so they lick each other (on the knee.. or the shoulder.. or the arm) as a new form of currency. (although this movie does have accidental incest so be warned) (i say accidental because these guys have been so brainwashed they don’t know what sex is it is supposed to be) (they don’t even know the concept of a name). the ways in which this man brainwashes them is so absurd. and the ways in which they respond to this conditioning makes perfect sense. my words still aren’t properly conveying what i feel for this movie but just ugh! it’s so strange it’s so fascinating it’s so beautifully told i love would absolutely watch it again.</p></div></div></div>

<p>pink flamingos (1972)</p>
<img src=/images/library/pinkflamingos.png class=cover>
<p>this is one of those movies that’s just so incredible and amazing, but i don’t think i would ever watch again. as my friend flavia said, the good parts are <i>so</i> good. and the bad parts are <i>so</i> bad. divine is such a cool character. she kills and eats cops. her politics are, and i quote “KILL EVERYONE NOW. CONDONE FIRST DEGREE MURDER. ADVOCATE CANNIBALISM. EAT SHIT.” and she’s incredible. she pisses on rich people lawns she steals she murders rapists she kills and eats policemen. these are all some of her greatest qualities. but then you know. she hangs out with nazis and fucks her biological son. so it’s like what the hell girl!!!!! i thought we had something special. it’s obvious that the movie was really going for like, Edgy Themes in the 70s which accounts for the Actual dead chicken (rip) and the rape scene <s>and the flexing asshole i will never be able to unsee</s> and the nazis she keeps as friends, i just wish they went a different route. you can’t have Divine be this badass cop killing man eater shoplifter rapist killer and then Also have her befriend Nazis and do weird incest stuff.. that’s my biggest frustration with the movie. but like besides that, i honestly thought the movie was hilarious i laughed so hard i cried. it was funny it was weird i’m so glad edie and her egg man had a happy ending and that the human traffickers were shot and killed. satisfying end plot wise i’d say. shrugs.</p>
<p>what i really valued was at the very end we got a bonus segment of the director John Waters sitting at his desk like “i hope you enjoyed my movie” like i didn’t just watch a man flex his asshole open and closed for however many minutes too long. this John Waters man is fucking insane. the segment was so much fun though he showed us deleted scenes and talked about how even HE didn’t really know what was going on in some of the scenes which was fun. i really needed that. i needed to hear this man Explain Himself. so like, yeah overall i really enjoyed that movie but like what the fuck</p>

<p>dead plate</p>
<img src=/images/library/deadplate.png class=cover>
<p>i randomly popped into a discord vc with friends and saw they were playing this game i'd never heard of, so i stuck around to watch the entire playthrough of <a href=https://racheldrawsthis.itch.io/dead-plate target=_blank>dead plate</a>. the art style of the game is super cute, and i'm a big fan of how they play into that in contrast with the scarier aspects of the game. i think one of my first thoughts as i was watching was 'this is kinda like if doki doki literature club and the tv show The Bear had a baby' (it's not really true but i had only been like.. 3 minutes into the game by that point). the story was short and sweet, which is something that i liked and at the same time Didn't like about it. if that makes any sense at all. it's a very cute game, but i wish it had been a little more developed. story wise? i just really fell in love with the homoerotic vaguely cannibalistic tendencies. cause vince is complicated? i want to play the game on my own again to really get a better understanding but i liked how vince Cooks people.. but he doesn't eat them? he's not really a cannibal except for that one time but that was more of a gay thing so.. i dunno. i like the weird distinction. anyways, dead plate is a very fun game and i've been thinking about it for the past 2 days before i realized i hadn't logged this game yet. maybe i'll update this word vomit mess when i replay this soon probably.</p>

<p>euphoria</p>
<img src=/images/library/euphoria.png class=cover>
<p>finally got around to watching this, and i ended up enjoying it way more than i thought i would. i went into this with low expectations, especially because i've heard about how awful the writer of the show is to the actresses behind the scenes. but the writing itself, was actually pretty good. i thought the show was really well made, they had moneyyy!! at first, my opinion of the show was that it's like riverdale but way less fun. and i think it's sort of true, euphoria takes itself way more seriously, but it pays off. i adore rue's musical scenes that follow her along the different parts of her journey with addiction. and i also love how they play with visualizing intrusive thoughts sometimes, like when rue and jules had nate tied up to a chair and on Fire, or the scene when cal shot himself in the head when his wife was like "dinner's ready" but the camera panned and cal just left his bedroom as if nothing happened (because nothing did happen). i think i described that awfully but whatever you know what i mean. i thought that was cool. my favorites are jules, rue, fez, and lexi has recently climbed her way up to the favorite character list. these guys carry the series. i love the rest of the characters too they just don't make me as emotional as those guys. i think my main beef with the story is that i don't like how they try to "humanize" or attempt to make nate and cal more likeable throughout the show because the way they do it feels... flat? just wrong. i wanted nate to be more likeable to me, but i just don't like him. so maybe that's not even a fault of the writing. i'm just mad i don't like him when i wanted to like him. i just really like villains who i hate but like at the same time, and nate is not that for me. anywho, i will most likely tune in for season 3.</p>

<p>man this movie was so good as an idea but pixar manages to find a way to fuck it all up in a way that's just so uniquely.. Pixar. i love the idea that this movie is all about re-learning to trust adults after growing up in an abusive household. and on the other side, what it means to parent when you think you're not good enough. just. kids who are traumatized by the adults in their lives can sometimes lash out on all adults, for boo they're all monsters. but she learns to trust some of the monsters like sully.. but especially not the lizard monster who's name i forget. and they have this whole conflict where lizard is desperate to get boo back and control her and exploit her fears for his gain. and sully just wants her to be safe.. the "she's not scared of you anymore" sealed the deal for me. that's when i was like this is about abuse and trying to give kids a better home. and when sully was put on the spot and asked to scare the robot tester kid, which ended up really scaring boo, made me sooo emotional. she was visibly triggered by sully being actually scary and she's going through a lot of conflicting feelings about who to trust anymore right now. and she's like, not even 2, probably. the guilt sully feels for scaring her like that, overwhelmed w feelings of incompetence i'm sure many actually good parents struggle with.. they only scratched the surface on this & dealing with ptsd i'm upset they didn't even try to explore it more genuinely..</p>
<p>also mike and sully are literally gay. like, seriously. they are written like a straight couple, but it's fun because they swap the gender roles when it's just them vs when it's time for them to parent. it's silly but i liked it. mike is the nagging wife (relationship wise) with all the times he's rambling on and on while sully is preoccupied and mike is frustrated he's not being listened to. and hes charming and flirty and all that. very socialized. way too comfortable talking to sully's mom and the phone and slapping his ass. but when it comes to parenting hes the distant reluctant father who's not down to do any work but will tell bad jokes and step in when it gets really bad. whereas sully is more of the chill guy, laid back, when it's just him and mike. but when he's parenting, he is the primary caretaker and the one doing all the emotional labor.</p>
<p>so, this movie was fine. it could have been insanely better given the concepts they were playing with. also if they bothered to put in an ounce of effort into the soundtrack and leaned into the jazz they used in the intro they could have given more depth to their evil capitalism underlying theme.. but no! fuck pixar, man..</p>

<p>inside mari by shūzō oshimi</p>
<img src=/images/library/insidemari.png class=cover>
<p>wah this manga series is unlike anything i've read before, and god was it an emotional experience. what starts off as a freaky friday trope ends up being an insanely vulnerable (? if that's the right word..) take on gender, body dysmorphia, and Identity itself. i absolutely love the way the freaky friday trope felt incomplete as we learn that while komori is in mari's body, mari is not in komori's. komori was still his loser self. and even then! i did not see the big reveal coming. learning about mari's relationship with her awful mother who completely shattered her sense of identity as a child by giving her a new name after her grandmother died. trauma after trauma was probably the first major way mari's sense of identity was fragmented. then we have her romantic feelings for other girls, which she felt like she could never express due to her social status at school and the fabricated identity of mari she upheld in public. she no longer feels attached to fumiko (birth name) or mari (the put-together, popular, “nice” girl at school). so naturally when dealing with all the above pressures, she projects onto komori. the college dropout hermit who, in mari's words, doesn't know how good he has it. to be free of the social expectations she had to conform to, to be able to love girls openly and honestly, to have a solid sense of identity. to be able to confidently say “i am isao komori.” and not have to question which name to use or which gender to perform. conjuring up this scenario in which she is actually komori who woke up in mari's body is such an incredible way to describe how detached she feels from her own body, her own self. and while her identity crisis is so reflective of the trans experience, at least my Own a lot of the time, i don't actually think mari is trans. what i found fascinating about this concept is that she plays with gender during her identity crisis to reconcile with the fact that she likes girls: it is much more socially acceptable for boys to like girls than girls to like girls, which is why i think mari is drawn to komori in this way. so, i think she's actually just a lesbian. but i love that this manga series allowed for her to explore gender in this way, i think it's so valuable for stories to incorporate concepts like this. i think that's all i have to say for now, i hope I didn't miss anything. oh and, one more thing. the illustrations in this series are fucking incredible. it's the first time i've actually noticed the difference intentional paneling makes when telling a story in this format, and god does this author make use out of it. the art style is soft and makes everyone look so human, and the paneling create a sense of pace and dramatic flair that i never thought was possible. i'm honestly in love with this story and will be recommending it to all my cool queer friends until the day i die.</p>
<p>also, <a href=https://medium.com/@eldarose/seeing-your-dysphoria-in-someone-elses-story-inside-mari-and-me-5a4e5b2a2412 target=_blank>this medium article</a> includes scans of the afterword to volume one of inside mari, which not only made me extremely emotional but also got me to pick up the series at first... also if you end up reading this series through this media log somehow please please please talk to me about it i'm dying to converse with someone about how beautiful this series is...</p>

<p>la sociedad de la nieve (2024)</p>
<img src=/images/library/lanieve.png class=cover>
<p>now <i>this</i> is how you make a movie about real life events. i had read a bunch of articles about this case a while ago, so i knew a lot about this plane crash and what came of it. but this movie told their story in a more beautiful and truthful way than any words printed on paper. my friend flo had some trivia facts she pointed out to me (like when some of the survivors appeared as background characters) which also added to my watch experience. god, this movie was just so well made. it's made me realize one of my favorite thing about a movie (or tv show, tbh) and it's how they play with sound. i don't know how else to explain it, but i just loved the moments of pure silence, which made the softer noises seem explosive. it's something they do a lot in The Bear too, which is what made me love that show so much. anyways. incredible movie. so nice to know that the survivors actually had control over how their story was told, how they gave life to the ones that died in those 72 days, and actually got to participate in it.</p>

<img src=/images/library/frankenhooker.png class=cover>
<p>this movie started off kinda bad but only got better and better. the premise of it all seems nearly identical to The Brain That Wouldn't Die, but i should have known better than to have expectations. because at first it's like, alright. society is fatphobic. let elizabeth eat her damn pretzels. but then it's like woah. i kinda like how this movie exposed the value hierarchy placed on women. like how jeffery's first plan of action was to kill a bunch of sex workers (who are de-valued by society) for their body parts to use for his dead girlfriend (who is a virgin and therefore 'pure') who he is Forcing back to life. like, no woman (dead or alive) has any sort of bodily autonomy and the narrative portrays it like the bad thing it is. lots to say about how bodies are used to define people, and how horrifying that can be (hence, jeffery's end, when he got a taste of his own... medicine) lmao. anyways i totally loved this movie. next year's halloween costume?</p>

<img src=/images/library/freddy.png class=cover>
<p>i spent the first forty or so minutes of this movie debating if i should turn it off. but then.. but then i started to like it. not sure if it's because it was 5 in the morning and i hadn't yet slept. or whatever. but i unfortunately thought it was really good. my favorite part was when gordy finally made the tv show about the zebras in america. the 'my dad was weird back home, but america made him crazy!' line was just too real. gordy is just like me i hate to say it. this movie perfectly captured what it's like to be the eldest son and be constantly at war with your father who's slowly losing his mind due to capitalism and stuff. also his bad spending habits were just too real. i too would stumble upon a million dollars stupidly and lose it all in under twelve hours. sounds legit.</p>

<p>i think this movie was made during covid times which makes the experience that much more eerie and fun. i had a blast watching this. idk why i didn't expect this to be a toxic yuri movie but it was, and for that i am eternally thankful. the relationship between charlotte and sarah made no sense. how they went from roommates to the most weirdly toxic couple with an assumed long history in 4 hours is something i will never understand. but i loved the twists. my one crit was that some of the scenes were so long it was painful to watch. the producers of this film were just dying to use their bird and lake footage, i guess. i liked it.</p>

<p>you know i'll be totally honest.. the main thing that kept me engaged throughout all two and a half hours of this movie was how absolutely stunning the main character is... Kenji Sawada is so pretty and gorgeous in this movie.. it was good though, i didn't hate it. considering how interesting the movie poster is, i thought the movie would be funkier. but it was just regular good. loooove the wardrobe for this movie. made me appreciate 70s fashion way more. i do think our main guy is balls to the wall insane. not because of the whole bomb thing, but because if it were me and i was making an atomic bomb for literally no reason, and had the most beautiful woman in the world flirt with me, i'd drop everything to be with her. but like, whatever man. he threw her into the ocean because he wanted to go home and cuddle with his plutonium! like, come on! smh.. gay people... also the last ten minutes of this movie were actually so ridiculous. why didn't the cop die after being shot fifty million times. why did kido survive the fall off the top of that building by... swinging on a cut telephone line. what. what. whatever.

<p>greener grass</p>
<img src=/images/library/greenergrass.png class=cover>
<p>this movie was absolutely mind boggling. when i finished it the first time i immediately re-watched it again with my friend lola because what the fuck. this movie was so good it's shocking. i am just so amazed at how these women wrote this story and all its surrealism. it's incredible. this movie is about a lot of things but the main themes that stood out to me the most were. what it means to be a woman. and the colonial hellscape that is suburbia. jill the people pleaser is a character that was just soo relatable. the way she bent over backwards to make everyone around her happy, and how the neglect of her own feelings are reinforced by everyone around her (when she's struggling to cope with her son becoming a dog and her husband is like.. can you not make this about yourself?) telling that one lady she named her daughter madison after the neighbor's mother when she literally didn't... she just wanted to make her feel good when jill was the one who needed to be consoled. it's so well done it's a little heartbreaking.</p>
<p>colonialism as the other underlying theme in this movie was so fascinating.. with the two classroom scenes on the western expansion, the 'i don't mean to be an indian giver', lisa stealing jill's baby, little helen stealing jill's house, playing soccer on a graveyard, the horse skeleton found in her backyard... throughout the entire movie we're given glimpses of the death and the irreversible aftermath of what american colonialism did to indigenous communities. it's like. suburbia is hell because of capitalism & colonialism and this culture of needing to conform and be better than everyone else at the same time. but it's void and empty at its heart because it's built on death and carnage. and it's enough to drive anybody mad. ugh there's just so much to this movie i want to write a more structured Thing about it but i don't think i will. too tired lmao. but like. god this movie was Insanely incredible.</p>
<p>also that fucking ending?! probably the best ending to a movie i've ever seen in my entire life. jill goes through this entire experience where it feels like she's breaking free from the cycle of hollow absurdity that is her suburban life (something to be said about the 'mating in captivity' book she reads/recommends in the movie) but she ultimately ends up going back to where she came from. but not in the same social position. it's probably the only time i've actually really liked a pessimistic? ending to a story. because at the end of the day, while she went back to this life she tried to leave, it's still a pretty great fuckign life. materially speaking? i don't really know. that's why i love this movie so much.</p>

<p>this was such a fun movie to watch. i started it on my own and stopped watching 10 minutes in because i realized i'd rather watch this with my friend so i did. which was a great choice. i absolutely adored the fact that it was mostly shot in tiny sets where all the buildings and props and cars were literal toys. it had such a fun DIY feel to it which made watching it sooo enjoyable for me. also, i was so shocked by the radical environmentalism in the movie? like yeah, fuck golf courses they're killing the planet and the indigenous people who are kicked out of their homes to build them on. and the one moment where they talked about the pinnacle of communist societies being their reliable public transit and universal free healthcare? i was so very pleasantly surprised. i only wish the eco terrorists got the happy ending they deserved lmfao.</p>

<p>starting an entry before i even finish this series because oh my GOD. i honestly cannot believe i haven't heard about this absolute gem of a manga until now?! our lovely main character, hibari is the coolest funniest prettiest most perfectest (trans!!) girl in the world. and this was written in the 80s! i'm about 5 eps in so far and am constantly overwhelmed by how cute and wonderful and amazing this show is. i'm also reading the manga alongside it because i literally can't get enough of this girl. though its still important to note that because this was made in the 80s, there are unfortunate instances of gross racist caricatures here and there which are pretty upsetting.. besides the casual transphobia from her family, hibari passes as a girl at school so everyone loves her and her love interest (kosaku) really actually likes her! and he knows she's trans! as of now he's still processing lol but i love the little moments he has where he's like "for some strange reason i'm really glad hibari didn't change..." its just. so cute and so healing. and watching this after just having seen love exposure is great. i am now officially on a roll of consuming trans girl media. 2024 is off to a great start.</p>

<p>lmao it was bad and boring for a Lot of the movie but i did appreciate the frankenstein-esque nature of it all. and conceptually this is one of my favorite things (tropes? idk) in fiction. i'm a big fan of anything that explores the relationships between the mind/soul and body. lots of opportunities to queer code media like this.. i will also say, the title is misleading! 'wouldn't die' implies this lady <i>wanted</i> to stay alive. the whole time the poor woman was begging to die.. it's her silly husband that kept her severed head alive to give her a new hot bod.. but whatever!</p>

<p>love exposure (2008)</p>
<img src=/images/library/loveexposure.png class=cover>
<p>i had literally no expectations for this movie going in. all i had read was the letterboxd summary and that was convoluted enough to get me interested. we got the porn industry, cross dressing, lesbians, gender identity and expression, kung fu and crime, and catholic guilt. and then you watch the movie and you realize the summary left out daddy issues and cult trauma. for a movie to cover all that. can you guess how long the movie would have to be? four hours. now i know this would probably turn off so many people. but i'm different. [homelander voice] i'm better! the best and only way to watch this would be in one sitting. which is very doable. the movie was Surprisingly really well paced. i was genuinely engaged the whole time and i never felt like the pacing was too slow or too rushed. i could give a summary here, for those of you reading this who are slightly interested but don't have 4 hours to spare. but i won't. that would make this already lengthy entry about three thousand words longer and google is free. i'm just going to talk about the transness and the lesbians. let me preface by saying this was made in 2008! an explicitly trans lesbian movie made in 2008! that's actually good (in general and for 2008)! a huge moment for me was at the very beginning, where yu loses a bet and has to dress up as a girl as “punishment”.. but yu ends up really enjoying it! “i walked like a cool chick,” he says. “i loved to be in drag. it made me feel good.” this happens before he even meets his love interest. why is that important? well. it would be so much easier, but hold way less meaning for the writers to have continued to go with the “dress up as a girl as a Punishment” bit and only have yu rely on the cross dressing as a means to get the girl he wants. but they didn't do that! he loved this new expression of gender all on his own. no motivations or influences or outside factors attached. it was genuine. he even gives this new persona a name. miss scorpion. who he falls back on when he needs to feel safe and strong. yu didn't think he was enough to break yoko out of the cult brainwashing. he felt he could only save her as miss scorpion. not just the woman yoko fell in love with, but as the woman who could beat up the bad guys and the woman who yu felt safe confronting yoko in. if that makes sense. yu and miss scorpion and yoko are so important to me. and this is weaved throughout the entire story, and in a way Confirmed at the end. when yu is in the psychiatric hospital he goes by miss scorpion— when he sort of loses it the person he feels safest and most comfortable as is miss scorpion.. not yu. i think there's meaning to that. it is undeniable that yu is a girl and that he and yoko are lesbians. like, how shapeshifting as a fictional ability is basically used to mean transness, breaking your lover out of psych wards is most definitely supposed to mean lesbianism. if you get it, Great. if you don't, i Will explain if you write me or something. just saying. i honestly doubt anyone reads these except for me but still. i think my only ick with the movie was that they wrote this story as a “young SA victim 'turns' lesbian as a result of her trauma” and the “i thought i was a lesbian, but I was just confused” trope, but in my opinion at least, the genuine transgender character arc and expression in the movie outweighs that. but like, it's still a valid criticism.</p>
<p>i think the theme of cults and organized religion was really interesting. i loved the way in which all three main characters had different types of religious trauma, and their reactions to it as they were growing up. the obsession with whiteness when it came to yu's dad and the Catholic Church was really interesting too. i'm not sure if the writers intended to comment on western Christianity and white supremacy, because other than the few lines of dialogue between yu and his father, it wasn't really mentioned again. but then again, there were so many religious references that went over my head because im not christian or catholic. what i really loved was that it brought up the hypocrisies of how people practice organized religion and at the same time come back to the idea that the most important thing about any worship is to do it from a place of love. which reminded me a lot of the major themes in the bleeding of the stone by Ibrahim Al-Koni. the moment where yoko recited Corinthians XIII at the beach while Beethoven's 7th Symphony in A Major, Op. 92: II. Allegretto plays in the background was one of my favorite moments in any movie i've ever watched..</p>
<p>on another note, the cinematography in this movie was insanely beautiful and campy. perhaps i'll add more here but for now. this is my new absolute favorite movie ever.. along with frozen 2 and DEBS.</p>

<p>it was a cute show.... but i did not like it as much as the boys. which is unfortunate because this show <i>should</i> have been just as good or even better... but it was just very average. my biggest disappointment was that none of the characters were insane red flags. they were too normal. their problems were normal their conflicts were normal. nobody was killing anybody for funsies! it just felt like a regular teen show. i'll still #tunein for the rest of the series because i didn't hate it... i was just expecting it to be as intense and campy as the boys... jordan is my favorite they were the main reason i watched the whole thing. i think the reason i feel so shrugs about this is because i made the terrible mistake of watching this Immediately after the boys. oops</p>

<img src=/images/library/cityofgod.png class=cover>
<p>this was the movie that taught me movies can have style. god i loved this movie so much. i can't believe i hadn't watched it sooner. i think my favorite part of the movie was our lovely narrator. i am obsessed with how skillfully he weaved us through the stories of all these characters and still made sure to keep a sense of cohesion between all of them. never at any point did i feel lost or bored as he was connecting the lives of these people in this movie. the camerawork was also so immersive, and i am a sucker for immersive experiences when it comes to the media i consume. one of my favorite scenes was the one in the beginning where they filmed the years go by as "carrot" (the subtitles translated their names instead of just spelling them out which is... annoying) took over his headquarters. the way so much history was shown in that one room. i have no idea if i worded that right.. there's a lot that i didn't mention because i'm a little sleepy after watching this but wow. if you haven't seen this movie, what are you waiting for??</p>

<p>the boys</p>
<img src=/images/library/theboys.png class=cover>
<p>holy shit i just watched all three seasons of this in exactly three days. right before the year ends. watching this show was a wild experience. from the exploding people to the weird sex to the bizarre psychological issues with these guys.. i loved it all.</p>
<p>homelander... oh homelander. he is such a fun character. scared the living hell out of me in the beginning, and still does. just in a very different way now. i appreciate his Brand of fucked up in the head and i really had fun watching him break down over the course of the first three seasons. it's very satisfying to watch a character's mental state unravel slowly like a ball of yarn, and this show portrayed it so well! and the actor too. the way you can see the Pained look in his eyes... and it's like. for what. whyyy. homelander is nuts. i love him.</p>
<p>i laughed Out Loud when i first saw erik kripke's name in the credits of this show. supernatural follows me everywhere i go. and then i see bobby fuckign singer. and then jensen ackles. it's just too funny. this show was made for me.</p>
<p>jensen as soldier boy was also soooo fun and exciting to watch. i loved him in this role. it was pretty jarring because the only other thing i've ever seen ackles in was supernatural. so to see my lovely dean winchester, the people's princess, the truest soul and the most Good character... also have the same face as fucking soldier boy the war criminal and enthusiastic brain smasher who smokes weed to cope with his untreated ptsd was a hilarious experience. they wouldn't even let him say fuck in supernatural!</p>
<p>something i wondered a Lot when i was watching this is how it will age in the future. they had soo many news and current events references throughout the whole show (the pepsi BLM commercial, lots of trump stuff, covid discourse references.. etc) i wonder if people who watch this in like twenty years will catch those references? not sure if that's a silly thing to even Wonder... but i still wonder...</p>
<p>also, props to The Boys for being the only show/thing Ever in my whole life to get me to like a french person. seriously. i couldn't (still can't) stomach listening to the language unless it's coming from frenchie's mouth. now it's fuck the french except for frenchie. him and kimiko were my favorite duo in the whole series. their love moved me, seriously. thinking about them for too long made me so emotional. i really just loved watching the both of them care for each other after all the horrors they've been though both individually and together. i just love seeing love found in the most unlikely of places. i will be tuned into this weird ass show when season 4 comes out...</p>

<p>i loved this movie! oliver was so fun to watch! from the cum bathtub licking to the dirt fucking to the naked dance party. the guy is just having a blast. i was worried i'd get bored of the movie when i saw it was two hours long (if you or a loved one have been affected by shortened attention spans due to excessive social media usage, you may be entitled to financial compensation), but i literally did not feel the time go by. the pacing was perfect. i loved the visuals in the movie too, the summertime shots, the red curtains cloaking the room in red, the funeral scenes, it was just all so visually appealing to me. i very much enjoyed this movie. very fun indeed.</p>

<p>my new boss is goofy</p>
<img src=/images/library/newboss.png class=cover>
<p>i literally never click on whatever crunchyroll's algorithm decides to recommend to me because it's usually bad, but i just. very randomly decided to go with with this new weekly that literally piloted yesterday? and it's safe to say that this was the right move. this is just such a cute little show about a guy who's had a horribly abusive boss and is currently starting at a new job! he's still very traumatized from his old job experience but his new stoic yet very goofy boss is showering him with kindness that momose doesn't really know what to do with. it's just so sweet watching his boss, shirosaki, teach him that it's okay to make mistakes as he creates the healthiest work environment for this new employee! it's so wholesome. i will be tuning into this weekly.</p>
<p>saturdays are my new favorite day of the week. shirosaki making the ad that led momose to gather the courage to switch companies brought me to tears. this is the most wholesome series ever i haven't experienced such a Raw serotonin boost from a tv show in so long.. they make me so happy! waaah °˖✧◝(⁰▿⁰)◜✧˖°</p>
<p><strong>christmas update: </strong>looks like that's a wrap for season one! i really hope they come out with a season 2 soon. this show is so comforting and wholesome i've never seen anything like it. i usually end up hating fluff/wholesome shows like these because they always tend to get extremely boring but this, this is just perfect. idk what they're doing right here but whatever it is, it's working. the characters are all perfect and funny and feel so real. and they're so sweet. this show is literally just therapy for me.</p>

<p>maaaaaaan. this movie was so beautiful. i really loved it. sad news is i ran out of adhd meds so my thoughts are very muddled so the next couple thought blurbs will be pure rubbish. my bad. i loved this movie soooo much though. visually it was beautiful. chen nian looking at the fish while beishan was looking at her was so beautiful to look at. among other scenes. nian clawing her way to some semblance of happiness with beishan, her shadow, watching out for her made me so emotional.. the duo just mean so much to me. "you'll protect the world, i'll protect you" i'd do anything for them. i liked the ending i was really worried this would have a tragic ending with beishan dying (20th century girl trauma lmfao) but seeing him come back again at the end after all the horrors was so nice to see. ugh. plan to rewatch soon despite the movie being two hours long.</p>

<p>this movie was absolutely hilarious the entire time. i loved how horribly toxic this friend group was, it was a perfect recipe for disaster. there was a good, old-fashioned, honest to goodness doomed toxic yuri dynamic between the two main girls. it was great. there was one 5 min sequence where the "gen z" lingo was getting a little too cringe.. stopped feeling natural. as if they last minute had an old man write 1 page of the script and then switched back to the original writer for the rest of the movie. besides that it was great. the ending.. was brilliant, in my humble opinion. of course pete davidson would accidentally kill himself making a tik tok. it was such a funny reveal.</p>

<p>suuch a beautiful film. i appreciate how it really felt like this movie was done with a lot of thought and care, which is evident. big fan of the eerie camerawork, it really felt like a classic horror movie a lot of the time. the tension was real. what really stood out to me was joe's relationship with his butterflies that gracie wasn't a big fan of.. the thought of him raising butterflies, watching them grow from caterpillars and get their wings, almost like he was wishing he could do that too.. it made me really emotional. and the way he let them go as soon as they were done growing made me think of how he reacted to his son saying he couldn't wait to leave home.. "i think that's good" like he too wants to leave. i just loved how they did that. a tragic story beautifully told, i think..</p>

<p>lmfao. was debating on adding this here but you know what. whatever yea i watched it. i think <i>for this genre</i> (which i haven't seen much of, nor do i plan to for the time being) it was surprisingly more sensitive than i thought it would be? i appreciated how seriously the movie seemed to take the depictions of re-traumatization when rape victims in particular are pressured or forced to recount their experiences whether it be for the news, for court, for a movie being made, whatever. i think that part was handled surprisingly well, as shown by our very unlikeable and pushy main character. i thought the way they set up the movie to be about the exploitation of sexual assault victims for public consumption While Literally Being an exploitation film itself was really interesting too, i didn't expect this to be so layered in this way. the end did feel off to me though, i get it sort of tried to go a surrealist route but it felt like more of a last minute thought? would have been cooler if those elements were more recurring throughout the entire movie? made the end fall a bit flat. but then again i am overanalyzing a pink film so.. overall i thought it was fine</p>

<p>belladonna of sadness</p>
<img src=/images/library/belladonna.png class=cover>
<p>i really enjoyed this watch. i didn't know what to expect, as i went into this movie completely blind, but i ended up really liking it. it's unfortunate that Jeanne's entire life and story is dictated by and influenced by the men around her, and the tragedy of it all is that her character and development are spurred on by sexual assault and violence. but what I really liked about the story was the emotional aspect of it all. while i'm usually supportive of the idea that rape scenes are not necessary to tell stories about these themes, the abstract and more artistic depictions of the tragic scenes in belladonna of sadness didn't glamorize or fetishize the assault, which is usually what happens in media. i thought it was more reflective of jeanne's emotional experiences rather than the king's power over her. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrbk7qjPPfk?si=QYCC3dPpfcMrwGYM" target=_blank>this video essay</a> touches on what i mean. also, one of my favorite quotes from the movie:</p>
<blockquote>your soul was screaming. i laughed, i thought i'd never laugh again. the darkness invites and seduces me. spit on by all. i want to become a horrifying woman, i want people to turn away in horror when i pass by in the street, i don't want to forget anger and hatred! <strong>who says anger and hatred are ugly? you are more beautiful than god.</strong></blockquote>
<p>this just resonated with me a lot. it felt real and genuine and I loved it, and this was my favorite moment of the whole movie. also, the animation and the music were both god-tier. from the couple of reviews i've seen, even the ones who hated the movie couldn't argue against how insanely beautiful the animation and soundtrack is. not even just “for its time” but of all time, and i agree with that. also, found it very funny that Satan was a literal dickhead. i loved it.</p>

<p>my year of rest of relaxation by ottessa moshfegh</p>
<img src=/images/library/yearofrest.png class=cover>
<p>i believe i could do this hibernation thing for a week. i believe it would fix me. real thoughts are i really loved this book a lot. it had no plot really, but it's sort of the point. i took this less as a Story and more as book about a Feeling. kind of felt like, ennui for girls. i think part of why i latched onto this book so hard is that i am currently in a rough place right now (filled with existential dread, stressed out finals season, unsure of what my future looks like, blah blah blah) so i just really resonate with her desire to barely be conscious and fast forward a year of her life. i liked the narrator she's very strange and mean, but very relatable. i was very shocked to see how it ended, i can't believe it actually worked for her. i honestly thought she'd die at the end but i'm glad she didn't. it's very fitting for her fucked up personality that seeing reva die on television was the final lose end she needed to cut to truly live her life, goes to show how much she valued their friendship, lmao. anyways i loved it, but i know it's not for everybody.</p>

<p>milk fed by melissa broder</p>
<img src=/images/library/milkfed.png class=cover>
<p>what a weird book! i really enjoyed it. i was really hooked in the beginning with the way Broder writes rachel's fucked up thought process, and i liked how despite all her weirdness, she was very relatable. i really loved the way she talked about food, she captured the Obsession aspect of eating disorders in a really fascinating way. i also really valued the way she navigated her relationship with food and with religion. food is usually a central pillar in religion and spirituality, like how the abrahamic trio fast for their special holidays and stuff, so i liked reading rachel's experience navigating her food struggles and her religion struggles at the same time. it was a cool way of intertwining the two.. Spheres. i also really loved the mealtimes with miriam's family even if it ended badly for her, i feel it was rly Good to see rachel have these moments of growth be grounded in food, even indirectly. i enjoyed the way her healing process was written. the biggest thing that sort of turned me off was the way the smut was a little too repetitive? i just felt like i was hearing the same sequence three times over towards the end. but maybe that's just cause i felt weird listening to like.. forty minutes of porn in audiobook form. like, i enjoy reading about bad sex (lol) and i really loved that first weird fantasy with ana i thought it said a Lot about rachel and her issues but towards the end it just got meh. but i'm not knocking it down <i>too</i> much because of that because i feel like reading the physical copy might be a different experience. at least, i hope. also while i'm happy for rachel's end as a Character i thought the book itself ended really weirdly.. it was so abrupt! i hadn't realized the book ended i had to re-listen to the last couple chapters to make sure i didn't miss anything! i think conceptually it was really good. appreciated the weirdness aspect. felt like Broder sort of.. got lost along the way. many good moments. more like 3.5 stars.</p>

<p>escaping twin flames</p>
<img src=/images/library/twinflames.png class=cover>
<p>my friend recommended this three episode cult documentary yesterday, and i really enjoyed the watch. i am fascinated by cults in general so this was right up my alley. twin flames universe operates under the guise of helping people find their twin flame, so you can see how easily it would be to deeply emotionally and psychologically fuck with people who are trying to find love. a former member got a hold of his google drive with all the recordings of their meetings to make this documentary. this leader, jeff, is truly evil and i felt insane just watching him talk to these people. he'd fend off any and all resistance to his.. Methods.. by just being like "nobody caressssss" like. he really thinks what he is doing is not that big of a deal.. watching this put me through a Rollercoaster of emotions. i am really glad to see the people involved in this documentary are healing from the horrors they've experienced. the one who touched me the most was Marlee. hearing her talk about what she's doing now that she's out just made me really emotional. i cried seeing everyone taking steps towards healing and the statistics about trans people and trans joy. anyways it was a good watch i think they made this documentary with a lot of care and it was done well. jeff will burn in hell for what he's done.</p>

<p>revenge</p>
<img src=/images/library/revenge.png class=cover>
<p><strong>tw for rape and gore.</strong> i haven't felt my heart beat as fast while watching a movie in forever. holy smokes was this movie good! visually and thematically, this is one of the coolest movies i've seen all year. i loved the bug imagery they had started us off with, i sort of wished they had followed that thread all the way through but it's whatever, it didn't bother me thaat much that they didn't. like when one of the guys pissed on the spider, i would have had the spider come back again to haunt him. given how spiders are used in a lot of literature/stories to represent resistance to colonial and Other types of oppression. i love jen so much, she is brilliant and incredible. i am so happy she killed them all for what they did, but my one critique would be that i wish the revenge killings were more personal. the first killing i thought was absolutely perfect, he saw her get raped and did nothing, she stabbed both his eyes out. i think the second guy she killed totally should have been castrated and died with his dick in his mouth. that would have been fitting for a) what he did but also b) to come back to his whole thing of feeling emasculated by richard. bonus points for postmortem humiliation. the final chase was really great, i enjoyed seeing richard run around completely naked, disoriented, with his intestines spilling out of him. her disappearing act with the tv blasting and the toy car in the pool that sort of made him feel insane was really great. a very satisfying watch.</p>

<p>the last vampire on earth</p>
<img src=/images/library/lastvamp.png class=cover>
<p>the vibes of this movie were soooo fun to experience, just overall. an authentic glimpse of 2010. i was a huge fan of the weird filter they put over the entire movie, i could barely see a thing and i loved it. chloe (aka our 'bella') is an anthropology major studying to become a missionary. like what the hell. her church being Against blood transfusions when she has AIDS was a crazy plot development. i really didn't see that coming at all. this movie was so chaotic. even though i don't like chloe, i appreciate her pulling a gun on her dad for trying to burn her vampire boyfriend at the stake like a Witch.</p>
<p>one thing i will say is that this movie made me think about how much i missed when people just had fun with making movies and tv shows. i sometimes feel like there's this Pressure to only create art that's Good (by what standards?!) or something. i love that these guys just made a full on twilight rip-off and had so much fun with it. it made me really happy. also Loved the music in this movie too. great stuff.</p>

<img src=/images/library/coneheads.png class=cover>
<p>i thought this movie would be way worse but it was actually pretty good. like a real movie. my favorite character was the wife. when she asked her Mate what he'd do if she died and he said "Ah, my most precious one, I would collapse. I would draw the shades and live in the dark. I would never leave my slar pad. My fluids would coagulate, my cone would shrivel and I would die, miserable and lonely." i knew this was officially a Good movie in my book. she was so happy to hear this. she also thought the bible was a comedy. i love her. i figured this was just a very silly movie about the immigrant parent/first gen experience in america told through coneheads. which was a surprise.</p>
<p>the song they played at the end credits was so good i looked it up and found out they had made a <a href="https://youtu.be/NMkaOtvRvVo?si=UIyhNKhXOGfL0qv9" target=_blank style=background-color:#9a6aa9>music video</a> for it, which is sick. go listen.</p>

<p>this was the. movie i've ever seen in my life but. but i don't hate it. i think i might even like it. i am so confused.</p>
<p>the title sequence played twice?? the whole movie was dubbed over. but i could still hear the original audio it was just a quiet echo. so strange. the dialogue? there definitely was. i had no idea what was going on the entire time. guy put his jacket in the freezer. as if it was a closet. it wasn't. it was a freezer. there was random newscaster epilogues that made no sense? anyways. evil experiment gone wrong monster baby birth everywhere. then they kill the monsterous THINGS. one thing i will say. i genuinely enjoyed the movie soundtrack. it was actually Amazing.</p>

<img src=/images/library/sharktopusVSwhalewolf.png class=cover>
<p>this movie could have been five stars. i took off four points because i am not a fan of the racist caricatures used in the movie. added one point back because at least the voodoo witch lady looked beautiful while doing her thing at the end. i just don't understand why you had to add racist caricatures of spiritual practitioners when this movie is supposed to be about a shark-octopus hybrid fighting a whale-wolf hybrid. also it was sad to see so many beautiful queens dying. but alas. hot babes must be eaten by sharktopus for the plot. i did Enjoy a lot of the movie the silliness factor was great the bad acting was great the cgi was great. could have been a blast if it didn't make me so grumpy. i hope the other movies are better.</p>

<p>river monsters</p>
<img src=/images/library/rivermonsters.png class=cover>
<p>i started watching this because it was my favorite tv show to watch as a child. when i was little i used to keep a journal of every single creature he caught and would do a page profile.. fun facts.. stats.. and stuff like that. i'm really sad i threw away that notebook it would have been fun to look through it now. anyways i really liked that show as a kid and got so excited when i found it on hbo.</p>
<p>the one thing i found really amusing about this show is how jeremy wade sets up each episode like it's a true crime show where he's hunting the Killer River Monster and spends the entire episode tracking down this creature and stuff and when he finally catches it? he lets it go. it's hilarious..</p>
<p>however the sad part about rewatching this show now is that every episode i am realizing how racist? this show is. i sort of knew it would be vaguely racist given the whole show is this white guy going into remote south asian and african communities to fish and gawk at their culture... typical anthropologist behaviors and such.. but what made me drop the show completely was when he caught a fish and refused to give it to the community to eat because he cared more for the fish's life than the "starving village" he's been talking about for the entire episode. it was just weird. don't re-watch your favorite childhood tv shows guys...</p>

<p>i regret being such a hater about this show without having ever watched it. i always used to say i wouldn't like glee because of the singing. because i had assumed the singing would be bad or average like how it is on riverdale. but no. i was so wrong. the singing is incredible i am baffled at how Actually Good this entire cast is. glee is incredible. glee is everything. it's camp. it's hilarious. it's so gay. sue sylvester is my favorite woman. she is funny and cruel and evil and she hates will as much as i do. we're soulmates, in a way. she also reminds me so much of mundane!au kenny it's hilarious. also she got ordained and married herself to herself? i did that in 2018 before i knew what glee even was. that's a kind of spiritual resonance i will never achieve with anyone else ever. i'm on season 3 now... enjoying it a lot so far. i'm watching it as i write this actually.</p>

<p>now this. is probably one of the best written most beautiful shows i've watched all year. i'm not feeling my best right now so just know whatever i say will not do this series justice you'll just have to watch it for yourself to understand. i love me a show with cute girls wielding guns. like madoka magica! but this is less tragic. still full of angst but with a happy ending can you believe it. real yuri not queerbait. and the girls aren't super weirdly hyper-sexualized! they are given the space to be cute and romantic and check each other out without being weirdly horny about it which is... unheard of for an anime lmfao. it's incredible i am so grateful. and i'm not one of those people who doesn't consider a relationship to be "canon" if they don't come out and outright say they're girlfriends but.. they did that here! they're literally girlfriends! out loud! it's so amazing. girls loving girls with a real plot too i know i haven't mentioned it yet but it's only cause it's an actual complex plot i can't explain in my current state. i'm just tired. the side characters are also beautifully developed for such a short series too! the tomato head guy who's name i forget is wonderful i love him. his sibling dynamic with chisato means so much to me. and the satosugu-esque tragic yaoi side story they had going on with mika and that white guy? incredible. i just love how they said the yaois can be gay and die but yuri will live forever. they're just sooo real for that! anyways i loved this show i will definitely be rewatching this later. my girls ♡</p>

<p>i'm not going to lie i was drawing while this movie on so i was only half paying attention to what was going on <i>but</i> i enjoyed this so much i don't think it's necessarily a bad thing... i very much enjoyed the use of jumpscares they made me feel nostalgic in a way. back when i was 12 and nearly pissing myself over slenderman and Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark... and that one youtube video that's like a car commercial but it's a scary mutilated lady with no eyes jumpcare. my mother showed me that video cause she thought it would be funny. then she put on shakira's whenever whenever music video to make up for it. i'm not sure why she thought that would work. anyways. i loved that they cast peeta from hunger games. i love that guy. he was great. the movie was very enjoyable. idk anything about fnaf lore but it didn't seem to matter much to me while watching. i will probably watch this movie again with a friend so i actually pay attention the whole time but. overall very fun. good vibes. silly.</p>

<p>suits</p>
<img src=/images/library/suits.png class=cover>
<p>my coworker buddy recommended this show for me to watch as i data entry away and to be honest. i didn't think i'd like it that much. it felt like succession but bad. however. i was wrong. i am so invested! comparing it to succession never made sense they're very different shows. i like suits a lot. the characters are very likeable. my favorites so far are donna (icon), harvey (the gojo satoru of pearson LLC), and louis litt (my favorite little rat man). this is technically a critique(?) but i find it amusing that these actors seem to have so little chemistry with each other that every romantic subplot feels like i'm watching robots pretending to be sims flirt with each other. oooh schlorba! (<strong>10-15 edit:</strong> i've now realized this really only applies to megan markle.. i'm sorry she is So gorgeous and a great person like in general... i guess. but acting is just sooo not her special skill..... i also just can't stand her character) except for donna, she's a star. anyways i find it amusing. nothing can convince me mike and rachel actually like each other.. i might have to stop watching it at work though, because i'm too into this show and it's distracting... one season down. eight more to go?</p>
<p>this show has officially entered the brainrot stage.. donna and harvey have quite literally put me in the trenches. i'm feeling stsg.. dare i say nanageto level chest pains right now over them. they are the only ones who understand real love. i am feeling so emotional over these two..... they are so special to me. the real stars of the show.</p>
<p>now that i've finished all 8 seasons i can say that was such an entertaining show!! i loved obsessing over it for the past... week. i really sped through this. the one time i felt disappointed was when they got mike out of jail and harvey offered him to work there as a consultant this time so it's legal and i was just like. what the hell! if this was an option why didn't they just do this the first time. what was the point of any of it. but i got over it. i'm going to be honest when i say i truly did not care all that much for mike and rachel. i just didn't think rachel was a likeable character at all, and started to get really sick of her when the only time she'd appear on screen was to wail and cry about the fact that she loves mike! so much! like. i get it. it just didn't seem like her character had much to offer. and because she was always with mike i just stopped being interested in him after he got out of prison. which makes it really amusing for me that the writers just cast them aside for the last season and focused on who i was really watching this for, donna and harvey. i have weird feelings about the completeness of the ending i guess, but i just am glad that harvey got the happy ending he deserved.</p>

<p>noragami (anime)</p>
<img src=/images/library/noragami.png class=cover>
<p>i feel like this entry deserves a lot more brainpower than i am able to give it right now, but i don't want to leave it out so i'll just have to half-ass this for now. noragami is honestly, probably my favorite anime of all time. i've never seen a story be treated with so much love and care. i especially love how all the character dynamics are written, each and every character is just filled with so much love. for each other, as characters themselves. it makes me very emotional. highlights of Peak Emotion from me were: the development of kazuma and veena's relationship & surprisingly, ebisu's story. i don't think there's anything in this world that can make me feel the way kazuma and veena feel about each other. they are my favorite display of love, ever. and i was surprised about how much i connected to ebisu's character. i usually don't like his type, but again-- the way he was written with so much love leaves me no choice but to love him! his reincarnation concept was fascinating and done so well. my favorite thing about noragami is that it shows us how powerful and important love can be, outside of a romantic sense of it. love is always understood as mostly romantic, but the love we see in noragami is both that and not, all of it and so much more. i'm going to be reading the manga soon and i am excited for the real brainrot to seep in.</p>

<p>gambling apocalypse: kaiji</p>
<img src=/images/library/kaiji.png class=cover>
<p>i started reading this series cause mizu recommended it to me and because i was very intrigued by the art style. it's such a fun series i am so glad i discovered this silly gem. i am fond of kaiji and his pathetic man nature, and i really enjoy the intensity of the games- it reminds me of squid games, i wonder if the show got some of their inspo from this series. probably not but... maybe. i find it funny that it took four volumes for kaiji to get through this crazy game of rock paper scissors, only to not win. that's my guy! i don't think this series will actually go there, but i hope these experiences have kaiji lead to the conclusion that the solution to all his problems would be communist revolution. he's honestly like, halfway there already. around volume 6 he started talking about wealth distribution so i was like... i see you kaiji.. the dots are connecting. although i really don't think that will happen. this is more of a silly marxist comparative analysis take. anyways, i really enjoy this series. kaiji is fun.</p>

<p>the secret history by donna tartt</p>
<img src=/images/library/tsh.png class=cover>
<p>do you ever read a book that changes you so drastically you can't pick up another book for few weeks? that's what happened to me after reading the secret history. i did not consume this book, the book consumed me. once i started i could not put it down! diving into this pretentious academic old school environment made me realize how much i love school, in a weird way. i guess i just really wish i had a tight-knit group of School Mates and i got to experience a piece of that through this story, despite how terribly things ended up for them... i was absolutely enamoured by henry winter since the very beginning (thank you to richard, our wonderfully fruity unreliable narrator!) and my love for him only grew once we got to see how insane this lad is. i was really charmed by his seemingly stoic and uptight demeanor at first while also at the same time learning that he is Very superstitious, and that he monologues about hypothetical plans to take over the school! i know i worded that terribly but for someone who was initially introduced as this super logical and cold guy, i really enjoyed seeing him be silly. and murderous. his cult leader vibes enchanted me. i am not immune. the prose was so fun and packed with ancient greek references i do not understand (yet) so i am glad that this is a re-readable book. i'm seriously looking at some classics classes for next semester because of how much this story impacted me... just. so good. need to find more books like this...</p>

<p>boy parts by eliza clark</p>
<img src=/images/library/boyparts.png class=cover>
<p>this is for sure one of my favorite books i've read all year. such an addicting page-turner, i got through almost all of it in one day. irina is my favorite female lead main character. deeply flawed, mean, completely and utterly unreliable, yet also... horrifyingly relatable. and funny! i can't even bring myself to hate her. reading as she goes through the motions of repeating the cycles of violence in her own fucked up way was really enjoyable. i'm not sure how to explain it just yet, but the way clark writes makes me feel like i'm in her head. despite doing awful terrible things, it was really fun to see her desperate desire to feel real, through her breakdown. to be taken seriously. <i><strong>Do I have to smash a glass over the head of every single man I come into contact with, just so I leave a fucking mark?</strong></i></p>
<p>and good God did i not see that big reveal coming. i'm not sure i want to fully spoil the Reveal, but i will say. my jaw was on the floor when irina (re?)discovers the old polaroid pictures with all the boy parts. this moment had so many striking similarities to how the big reveal in OMORI was done, so i appreciated this in so many different ways. ever since reading minor detail by adania shibli, i've been a huge fan of gothic elements in stories like these. the inability to tell what's real from what's imagined in irina's mind was so fun to read, and even better when i go back to reread, which i already plan to do very soon. i feel like now that i know the full story, rereading will let me notice so many more times where irina's sense of reality was destabilized. i am very excited to reread this beautiful work. very dark but very good.</p>

<p>i was so excited to see where this sequel to go and i was so disappointed! this movie sucked! they took everything that was good and cool and charming about the first one and just..... fully ignored it. didn't use what made the last movie so good. it didn't feel like as much of a body horror film as the first one did? it felt like a regular horror movie. the horror felt less personal, in a way. i felt no connection to martin, at all. which is really the only person i could have possibly feel connected to given how awfully written every other character in this movie was. and the gore wasn't even that interesting. it wasn't... horrifying! like i'd expected it to be. thumbs down from me on this one.</p>

<p>after seeing some clips on my twitter feed, i sort of knew i would really like this movie. it felt like the perfect mixture of campy high school silliness that would appeal to me. and i ended up loving it so much more than i expected! the cast is hilarious, i've seen clips of ayo edebiri and rachel sennott being besties off set and it was so fun to see them as best friends in the movie as well. you could tell. their friendship is really cute. i laughed so much during the movie i cried a little bit (i'm a crying laugher? laughing crier? whatever). every time someone would mention making a bomb i thought it was just a gag, but they actually did it. every time. it was great. the last thing i expected were for people to die in this movie. brilliant twist. honestly, a perfect movie. more or less. i plan to see this movie in theaters again and also own it in DVD. i hope the physical copy comes with a blooper reel. i know the blooper reel must be so funny.</p>

<p>what a fantastic movie! wowie! i really had fun watching this. i didn't expect early stage brundlefly to be so funny about turning into a bug. he was absolutely hilarious despite also being so miserable about it all.. it's quite heartbreaking if you think about it, actually. my favorite line was when he said <strong>"i am an insect, who dreamed he was a man and loved it. but now the dream is over, and the insect is awake."</strong> lots of queer gender thoughts to be had about this movie. the movie strangely does a great job at articulating how it can feel to hate the way your body is developing. it's interesting to watch Brundle struggle with living in a body he doesn't want. the guy kept his penis in a jar in his medicine cabinet for... historical purposes. for christ's sake! i would have really liked to see Brundle rub his hands together like a fly, though. i also thought brundlefly's final evolution was strangely cute. i would have kept him as a pet if it were up to me. it's the eyes! they made him adorable...</p>

<p>i went into this game completely blind, so i really didn't know what to expect. i had such a fun time exploring the environments, i really loved how cartoonishly tall all the furniture and rooms are in the house areas, and how my character has to move stuff around to reach high doorknobs and things like that. it had a really child-like perspective to it but that didn't take away from the eeriness of the experience, either. i hope that makes sense, the feeling is hard to describe. i am a huge fan of the grotesque monsters we meet in this game, especially the janitor guy with the wicked long arms and the twin chefs! i found them so adorable i really wish they had plushies out of these guys that i could buy.. i am surprised at how short the game is, i finished it in around four hours. i might try to go back later and see if i missed anything, but it seemed to me that it's just a short game. i also wish there was more of a story, but that's just because i <i>love</i> stories. i plan on playing the second game soon, though. i can't wait to see where this series takes me.</p>

<p>i find it very amusing that my media log entry for one of my <i>most favorite</i> animanga series is so lame.. well good thing i have a <a href=shrine-jjk.html target=_blank style=background-color:#9b6ba9>shrine</a> dedicated to jujutsu kaisen to make up for this sorry entry...</p>
<p>august update: i'm coming back to this entry after watching gojo's past arc animated in season 2. i think the animators did a beautiful job. it was so refreshing to see gojo and geto's childhood memories in such bright colors. gojo really remembered his youth fondly. it's really telling given his belief that youth should never be taken away from children... despite reading and rereading this arc in the manga so many times, watching it felt like an entirely new experience. the music was funky but really good. i thought it was really intentionally composed. the detail i'm currently latching onto is the scene where nanami throws a stool across the room when he gets news of haibara's death. it was so jarring to see teen nanami, who seems so composed, display such raw emotion. it was so heartbreaking to see nanami's own anger with jujutsu society, when he mentions the mission wasn't meant for a sorcerer at his level.. they were only kids, after all.. this scene always reminds me of the tidbit we got from the official fan-book, where it says that nanami doesn't blame geto for becoming a curse user. nanami was angry too. it's why he left.</p>
<p>this story is so tragic. in the most beautiful way. i love being reminded of words and memories of the past as the story develops. like how yorozu's words seem to live on and get repeated during gojo's fight with sukuna. like how gojo's present day morals and goals are exactly what geto's were when they first met, as kids. gege seems to like doing this too, so i'm glad we're on the same page. watching the anime made me very emotional about this again. i can't wait to see where this story goes after this...</p>
<p>march entry: i used to be so normal about jjk since i first started watching the anime last year. but with the way this story has been developing i've gotten so obsessed with it? it's like a delayed reaction almost.. shibuya arc was absolutely devastating (<strong>#shibuyasurvivor</strong>), i read the whole thing in two days with my hand clutching my chest the whole time... can't think about it for too long or else i'll get nauseous. now i am caught up on the culling game arc where my biggest issue is getting attached to characters (higuruma.. kirara, hikari, <a target=_blank style=background-color:#9b6ba9 href="https://twitter.com/hiraethiaa/status/1632442622445867012?s=20">kaori & jin</a>, and now yorozu... my darlings) who either will never show up again or die a horrible brutal devastating tragic death... gege is a wicked man... worst of all is that my Favorite character in the entire series is kenjaku. who is sure to meet his demise sooner or later... pray 4 me and all the #kennyfansinternational... i wish gege would let my babies be happy..... meguyujibara NEED a happy ending or else... or else..... or else!!!! [explodes]!!!!!<p></p>

<p>20th century girl</p>
<img src=/images/library/20thcenturygirl.png class=cover>
<p>i went into this movie having no idea what to expect. at first i really hated the love triangle trope because seeing their dynamic together made me want them all to be best friends. they were all really cute with each other. but i eventually got over it. i'm giving this a high rating because this movie did such a good job at... appealing to Emotions. i don't really know a better way to describe it, so forgive me. but the end of this movie had me sobbing like a baby, which i really was not expecting. that final scene at the end where we see the videotapes our main guy recorded of his time in korea pushed me over the edge. i hadn't cried like that in so long. i think that scene alone was so good it Made the movie for me. besides that, i was a little disappointed about how they handled the love interest death. we don't even know how he died! so, i would have rated this movie lower if it wasn't that final scene. it was just so perfect and Raw it boosted the movie so much for me. still glad i watched it.</p>

<p>the scum villain's self-saving system (1) by mo xiang tong xiu</p>
<img src=/images/library/scumvillain1.png class=cover>
<p>i brought this with me on my trip to morocco as my Official Summer Read but i didn't have much time to read while i was over there. overall i'd say this book was Alright. the writing felt cheesy at times and for a while in the middle i was starting to get bored of it. however, i do really like how this volume ended, so i'm not fully giving up hope. i really want to see how luo binghe's development diverges from his "fate" and all... i have a feeling it will get better from here. i plan on reading something else before picking up the second volume of this series, though. so, not too bad. but not too good either.</p>

<p>the handmaiden (extended version)</p>
<img src=/images/library/handmaiden.png class=cover>
<p>knowing how to start this entry is so hard because WOW. i really loved the handmaiden. i watched the extended version without realizing it and i think that was the best decision i've ever made because i truly lost myself in this movie, if that makes any sense. from the beginning i fell in love with the cool cinematography. i loved how they knew exactly when to linger on a specific shot. it made me feel like i was living those moments too. the viewer almost seemed like a curious onlooker for a lot of it, which i thought was cool. one moment in particular that stood out to me so much was when sookee, hideko, and the fujiwara imposter were running off so hideko and fujiwara could get married, and on the way they showed hideko eating one grain of rice at a time. followed by them walking up the steps to the designated place and hideko is behind them all, climbing one step at a time. i read that as hideko wanting to postpone or stall this marriage as much as possible as a Show of how much she did not want to marry this man. i just thought portraying those feelings in that way was so beautiful. one of the coolest moments in the movie, in my opinion.</p>
<p>speaking of the fujiwara imposter, my feelings for him dramatically flip flopped after the plot twist where we learn that him and hideko had actually established a business-y relationship/agreement between themselves. i loved that he had no power in any of the relationships he was in, and i will never forget his Final Scene. i still think he's a shitty guy, but i will always be amused by him asking for cigs mid-torture session and smoking mercury to get out of his sticky situation.</p>
<p>i loved the switching back and forth between korean and japanese, and i think it says a lot about language as a form of intimacy. specifically in regards to how hideko and sookee communicated with each other versus how they each spoke to other people. it was beautifully reflective of not only class but also relationship dynamics too. i wish i had learned more about japanese korean history before watching this (beyond surface level information), i would have liked to see how that was incorporated into the film (as i'm sure it was, it just would have went over my head)... </p>
<p>my only ick was that the last sex scene felt like it was written by a man who has never spoken to a lesbian in real life. the other ones were great, though. but this wasn't worth taking a star off. the scissoring was just, like, whatever.</p>
<p>overall i am so happy with this movie and the way the story was told. i seriously didn't think my girls would have a happy ending! but they did! too many years of consuming toxic doomed yaoi had dimmed my hope for happy endings. but yuri always saves the day. god bless.</p>

<p>trigun: badlands rumble</p>
<img src=/images/library/badlands.png class=cover>
<p>okay so i gave this movie a pretty low rating for a couple very unimportant reasons. maybe i just wasn't in the mood to watch this movie because i was really bored for most of it... i also was not a fan of the wolfwood and vash interactions... the way their dynamic was written was not very appealing to me. vash was wayyy too horny brained and wolfwood was just all alone again? when in every other iteration of trigun wolfwood is terribly losing the idgaf war and is always finding a way to be around vash. it just felt very out of character. also was not a fan of the fact that wolfwood looked so pale. who is preventing him from seeing the sun!! let him out!! it's not like i Actively dislike this movie, but it's not something i really care for.</p>

<img src=/images/library/twenties.png class=cover>
<p>i started the first two episodes of hello, my twenties! on the plane and i'm hooked! thank you to my friend carlea for this recommendation. so far the show is sooo cute. ye eun was not a favorite of mine at first, but she is starting to slowly grow on me. i adore the rest of the girls so much. if i had to pick, i'd say ji won is my number one favorite character. she is so fun and lively and funny and i will never understand why it's so hard for her to get a boyfriend.. she's perfect! my favorite moment so far was her teaching eun jae how to let loose and dance. she's just such a great person. i understand why eun jae idolizes her so much...</p>

<p>the summer hikaru died</p>
<img src=/images/library/hikaru.png class=cover>
<p>i'm now all caught up on the summer hikaru died and i am a <i>huge</i> fan of it already! the first chapter hooked me. i really love the body horror aspect of the story. as well as the psychological horror! the intimacy of holding your loved one's organs in your hand is something i can really appreciate..</p>
<p>hikaru and yoshiki also remind me so much of kenjaku and jin from jjk... (i've got terminal 'make everything about jjk disease' my bad). but it's really not my fault. they call 'hikaru' <i>lord brain snatcher</i>... like come on! i seem to have a pattern of getting really attached to this trope of "i know it's not you but i'd rather have you like this than not have you at all" and i'm not mad about it. i'm really excited for the english volumes to be released, this is absolutely something i want physical copies of in my bookshelf ＼(≧▽≦)／</p>

<p>trigun (1998)</p>
<img src=/images/library/trigun98.png class=cover>
<p>i literally just started this but i already have a couple thoughts. firstly, i just read that the first episode released on my birthday. in 1998, though, before i was born. but still! i think vash is so fucking hilarious. the dialogue is really funny, and vash's voice actor is incredible! it's so cool they got the same guy to voice him in the 1998 and the 2023 version. it's so nice to see meryl and millie be animated. god i love them so much!</p>
<p>i think episode 23 was the most batshit insane sequence of events i've ever experienced. they can't expect me to take "will you eat these sandwiches.. with me?" as a serious thing. i can't believe they actually fucked. millie is so unserious.. i think it's really funny that wolfwood stayed up til the sun rose chainsmoking afterwards i wonder what he was thinking about (gay thoughts)</p>
<p>things i like about this version:</p>
<ul><li>Millie Thompson</li>
<li>Vash being really silly and funny</li>
<li>Wolfwood's top tier sleaziness and sliminess</li>
<li>Vash and Knives having long hair as kids</li>
<li>guitar music</li></ul>
<p>things i did not like about this version:</p>
<ul><li>Meryl is a lot dumber</li>
<li>Monev should not have had read speaking lines</li>
<li>Meryl should never be mean to Millie!!</li></ul>
<p>highlight of the last episode was the flashback of vash nearly crushing knives' head in with a rock. how cain and abel of them. knives would have enjoyed the thought that went into this.</p>
<p>overall i think it was Fine. in my head it exists as a nice little silly adaptation of trigun but i wouldn't say its Good. that sounds mean though. i did still enjoy watching this a lot..</p>

<img src=/images/library/slamdunk.png class=cover>
<p>after seeing mizu's posts about slam dunk i've decided to finally start it. i've been really sick the past few days so i figured Now is best time to start it. i really miss older anime actually giving characters lips. i wonder why they don't do that anymore.. i really love our main guy but i wish he'd stop calling the only Black character a gorilla... i know this is 1993 but still..... Not Cool, Man.</p>
<p>i do love how hanamichi's first introduction is him getting rejected for the 50th time! with his friends celebrating for him. always have each other's backs when they need it most. a good group of guys. hanamichi just joined the basketball team so i'm excited how things turn out for him!</p>

<p>the babysitter: killer queen</p>
<img src=/images/library/babysitter.png class=cover>
<p>i watched the first babysitter movie several years ago and thought it was really fun. i had no idea there was a sequel until i found it while netflix browsing yesterday. this movie was pretty fun, i did Enjoy watching it. even though the acting was really bad. and the main character was like a jughead jones but less funny. i absolutely loved jenna ortega's performance in this though, she does so well in campy horror movies. i also think that "sex scene" where they had a bunch of... flower blooming videos and dancing while Jump On It by Sugarhill Gang Apache was playing in the background was. Absolutely incredible. Favorite sex scene I've ever watched in a movie. which is probably a strange thing to say, but it's true.</p>

<p>trigun maximum by Yasuhiro Nightow</p>
<a href="https://myanimelist.net/manga/703/Trigun?q=trigun&cat=manga" target=_blank style=background-color:transparent><img src=/images/library/trimax.png class=cover></a>
<p>i downloaded over twelve hours of television to keep me entertained on my six hour flight. instead i read three volumes of trimax and knocked out. enjoy my silly little blurbs as i read each volume throughout the summer.</p>
<p><strong>trimax #1:</strong> I wonder how many times Vash will accidentally destroy half a planet and ghost everyone for a few years. I loved seeing Old Man Vash in this trying to live the simple life. Very enjoyable vashwood interactions in this. They're both just sooo weird they were made for each other. Wolfwood is feeling very girlcrush right now. Okay I think we just landed in New York I have no more thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>trimax #2:</strong> For someone who calls himself a priest and the devil in the same breath, Wolfwood sure does have a way of acting real omnipresent the way he's always around when Vash is in trouble (though his help is rarely ever actually needed lmfao). I've never seen anyone lose the idgaf war (chainsmoking while replaying the memory of vash calling him a coward over and over again in the middle of the night) so badly and that's <i>a lot</i> coming from me. The reference to their first conversation about Vash's genuine smile and Wolfwood trying to make himself a bigger demon than he actually is “while his own heart cries out” was really good. I had to pause. I think my favorite part of their dynamic is how they just see right through each other! For the most part. From the moment they laid eyes on each other. I think that's pretty neat. Leonof is definitely the most fucked up of the Gung-ho-gun gang.. the puppets of Vash's family falling apart in his hands is just so cruel.. I love the themes of Family in this series. Vash and the family he dedicates his life to honoring, Wolfwood and his kids he kills to be there for (nico niiiiii), Millie and her monthly newsletter to every single one of her extended family members, Knives dedicating his entire life to getting Vash to be by his side. It's all just so good. No real thoughts just Good.</p>
<p><strong>trimax #3:</strong> I think it's interesting how the main point of contention between Wolfwood and Vash right now is whether or not it is inevitable to kill. And I think I'm starting to understand both of them and the Issue at large here. I think what pisses Wolfwood off so much— how Vash seems to recklessly sacrifices himself every fight— is that he seems to be able to do this from a point of privilege (I don't think this, I think this is what Wolfwood thinks). I'm starting to see that more with the repetition of WW's inner monologue questioning if Vash is Human or Monster. I think the fact that Vash has the abilities to make it through these situations in which he definitely should have died, can be read in one way as he can afford to risk more. Because he knows he'll make it out alive. And Wolfwood is frustrated with his seemingly lack of self-preservation. This might be stupid but that's sorta what I'm getting from his whole "do you not even care what happens to you" vibe. I'm okay with being wrong about this. Also, I like how Wolfwood hasn't realized yet that Vash has no regard for his own well-being. So he's always shaking his fists like Vash whyyy do you do this to yourself and he's like. ☆⌒ヽ(*'､^*)chu I Deserve This. Yeaaaah these guys have got some real issues i love them so much.</p>
<p><strong>trimax #4:</strong> wolfwood has gotten more time to shine this volume and i'm loving it. I really enjoyed watching him beat Nine Lives to death. I was wondering when they'd let him do that after all his monologuing about the necessity of murder and killing to survive and blah blah blah. Loved that! And the hospital scenes!! These were my friend's favorite chapters and I can totally see why. They're mine too so far. Wolfwood is finally starting to Conscioulsly (as opposed to subconsciously) understand Vash and why he does what he does. He's so attached it's really fun. Vash loves him a lot clearly, and Wolfwood is just always around and pretending to not enjoy it like “you need me so bad it's embarrassing” (he's projecting). I'm really excited to see more of Knives and his evil plan to uhhhh convince Vash that he was right all along? I love Knives so much he's so silly and so amusing I love every panel that he's in and I hope she shows up more in the next volume. I would love to see more interactions between him and Vash and maybe even Wolfwood too..</p>
<p><strong>trimax #5:</strong> Knives will always be such a funny villain because he genuinely thinks Traumatizing Vash even more will surely work in his favor. If his main goal is for him and his brother to work together and be One Team, you'd think he'd be more open to compromise... or at least. Not Traumatizing him every chance he gets. My favorite moment in this volume was this small scene towards the end when Vash claps his hands and bows to pray at the cross, and Wolfwood makes a comment about being in the wrong faith, which reminded me so much of what <a href=https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Bleeding-of-the-Stone/Ibrahim-al-Koni/9781566564175 target=_blank>the bleeding of the stone by ibrahim al-koni</a> is all about. The different ways to pray and worship, the commentary about the “right” and “wrong” way to worship, what the difference it makes as long as you can put “more feeling into it” as Vash says.. I actually thought that moment was really cool. There are lots of connections to be made between Vash as a character and this book actually. I wish I had my book with my notes with me so I could go more in-depth on this... The main character & Vash share similar values on Life and carry radically opposing beliefs to their surrounding character's Kill Maim Destroy (being dramatic here) mindset. Asouf's veganism & Vash's pacifism. Oh wow there's actually so many similarities. Religious themes... struggle between what is good and evil... the twins... Redemption... for Vash and for Cain... I hope I remember these thoughts when I get back home and have the energy to write a paper on this.</p>
<p><strong>trimax #6:</strong> vash's struggle with self-forgiveness and guilt reminds me a lot of yuuji's struggles in jujutsu kaisen. i was so excited for livio's introduction in this volume! except we didn't see him much. but i think he'll be around more soon. at least, he better. sped through this one so it feels like a blur.</p>
<p><strong>trimax #7:</strong> I really enjoyed comparing the anime adaptation with the manga for a lot of the scenes in this volume. the tessla flashback scene where they detail the horrors they put her through For The Sake Of Science was truly horrifying. Even more fucked up in the manga than it was in the anime. loved seeing knives be just. absolutely insane here. he's so stupid it's really enjoyable for me. loved all the vashwood moments too. the brothers face off yet again I wonder what disaster will follow in their aftermath...</p>
<p><strong>trimax #8:</strong> okay this was such an emotional rollercoaster. we see wolfwood try and fail miserably to not gaf as he sees Vash off to his death. Presumably. dramatic goodbyes and all. And after all this time he's spent arguing with Vash on how necessary it is to kill in order to survive, I loved seeing him struggle to do so when it came to Livio (which I was SO happy to see BTW) and with any of the Eye of Micheal... his family.. I know it's mostly because of the brainwashing and conditioning he's been through, but another big part of it is that he was essentially made Parent to all of those children since he was 8 years old. So obviously, there's no way he'd be able to kill them so easily. Especially Livio. God, those Eye of Micheal guys are so evil. “I beg you.. the young ones.. all I wanted was to save them..” was so brutal. But what was even more emotionally devastating was Vash's “that man bet his life on me. He feared death twice as much as the others.. and did his best to hold onto life. You really think I care whether I win or not? He is reason enough to fight.” Oh I wanted to bash my head into the wall. We've already seen that Wolfwood would do anything for Vash, but this coming from Vash was so good to see. Also, that Wolfwood spinoff chapter HURT ME SO BAD.. visiting his kids from the orphanage who don't remember him because they were only babies and because he grew up so much made me so miserable. Every time I see those cult indoctrination flashbacks I feel so miserable.. man..... Wolfwood......</p>
<p><strong>trimax #9:</strong> LIVIO RAZLO WOLFWOOD FIGHT WAS SOOOO GOOD. more cult content i really loved to see. it is so fucked up that those orphans didn't recognize wolfwood when he saw them again... when one of them was like "i think i knew him when i was younger but.. he shouldn't be that old" a part of me died. wolfwood giving livio a hug trying to get to him.. just so good. i loved seeing razlo he is so much fun. he's really just there to protect livio the only way he knows how (the bad way). i was thinking about how fucked up he is because the only people he has ever had contact with were 1. that evil chapel guy and 2. whichever group of people that would beat up and abuse livio. so he has had 0 socialization besides. protect livio. kill everyone who gets in your way. me personally, i loved seeing my fav guy Wolfwood get pumped full of bullets and then stand back up. i really like how they set this up as a battle between wolfwood's past and present. both literally (livio representing who he was, versus him now) and thematically (?) (wolfwood's internal monologue battle between what he has Always Known and what he loves about vash) it's just so good. i am so excited but so nervous for volume 10..</p>
<p><strong>trimax #10:</strong> i will never be the same.</p>
<p><strong>trimax #11:</strong> as devastating as the last volume was, I'm really grateful for the new livio & vash friendship. their bond means so much to me. I was so happy to see millie and Meryl reunite with vash, but the pages where Millie cries because she didn't get to say Goodbye to wolfwood made me tear up for realsies. The paneling, her expression right before she starts to cry.. Vash unable to look her in the eye because he knows his face will give it all away.. everything about that was incredible. Also. Zazie pulling a control bug out of her cooch was the LAST thing I expected out of this volume. Appreciated, though. Meryl & Vash's special fist bump made me cry. It's just. Too cute. And the fact that I now know the story behind Livio's hat makes me love him so much more (than I already did).</p>
<p><strong>trimax #12:</strong> OH. knives.. really doesn't like having guns pointed at him, huh.. this fight between vash and knives so fucking Beautifully written I'm going to throw up. Vash trying to protect human life and stop knives from Arrogantly pulling the trigger Only for the military to do just that.. oh man that was so good I had to close my eyes for a bit and let that simmer. Their conflict is just so good.</p>
<p><strong>trimax #13:</strong> RAZLO COMEBACK LETS GOOO! oh how I've missed you silly man.. the livio razlo elendira fight was actually so much fun. the quick memory panels of wolfwood and of razlo and vash after seeing that vial drop in the middle of the fight were so good. god and when livio asks for razlo's forgiveness.. I almost cried it's just all so beautifully done. razlo deserves so much love and care he cares so much. About livio. and his ness friends. Having someone to protect. this volume was dedicated for razlo lovers and I'm so glad nightow did this for Me. Personally.</p>
<p><strong>trimax #14:</strong> god i don't have the energy to write out my full thoughts on this but. what a perfect manga series. seriously. the ending was perfect. vash is perfect. knives. perfect. everything. so good. perhaps i'll be more coherent with this later but i can't wait for some time to pass so i can reread this again.</p>

<p>do revenge</p>
<img src=/images/library/dorevenge.png class=cover>
<p>i was debating whether or not to give this 4 or 5 stars. i couldn't come up with a reason to knock it down a star. so this movie was 5 stars. it was so enjoyable. i watched this with my cousin and it was so great. visually, the costume designs and the set and the whole Look of the movie was so appealing. i wish i went to a school that had such nice school colors. this was a really simple, cute, and silly movie, i loved the revenge plots and the obnoxious fake woke liberalism of it all. and i loved it especially because i did NOT see that plot twist coming! i predicted a bunch of other smaller things throughout (because i like doing that) but this wowed me. and i love that they got back together in the end and bonded. for most of the movie i was rooting for the revenge duo to become endgame, but i'm glad they didn't. or at least, i'm really happy with their friendship. a very fun watch. would recommend.</p>

<p>i don't have many thoughts on this but i enjoy junji ito's horror stories. the edition i had included a couple bonus pages of his notes after each chapter, and i thought it was cool to see the beginning stages of each of these stories. my personal favorite was the one with the puppet masters being controlled by the puppets. the evil french puppet had such a fun energy to him and i loved how everyone was lured into being controlled by little strings. i think if it were me i'd willingly join in. and then die, obviously. i was not made to be a surviving horror series character.</p>

<p>trigun by Yasuhiro Nightow</p>
<a href="https://myanimelist.net/manga/703/Trigun?q=trigun&cat=manga" target=_blank style=background-color:transparent><img src=/images/library/trigunmanga.png class=cover></a>
<p>after watching the new trigun stampede anime, i was really excited to start reading the manga it was based off of because i couldn't get enough of vash, wolfwood, meryl... and i am especially looking forward to more livio/razlo content too. one of my friends is reading it and i'm catching up so we can chat about our favorite sillies. i love the slight difference in characterization of vash in the manga. i'm sure it's probably just because this is the beginning of his story, but i love how silly he is in trigun! there was a moment where he meets this kid, buys his Obviously Fake Sob Story, feeds him, and then jumps into an existential crisis monolgoue about if humankind really deserve to live on such a planet. it's moments like these that have me thinking that him and wolfwood really do just Get each other. freaks who ride on the same wavelength. i also love that meryl and millie are gay in this. and that they adopted a cat together. i would love a bonus chapter (or two... or three or four) of those two engaging in silly mundane antics i think it would be so fun to see them in some low stakes situations. i was not expecting their dynanic to be explored so much in this part of the series, but i'm so glad it was. i tend to get very attached to characters that value Family as much as millie does, and being able to see her aggressively fight for her values was really fun. for such a silly seeming gal she has a lot of depth to her that i appreciate. so excited to read more!</p>
<p>after reading volume 2 of trigun, I have to say I really like Wolfwood's characterization in the manga! Compared to the anime, he's way more queer! And a lot more giddy and charming while still having 0 social skills. It's a really fun side to him I didn't expect but love very much. I am interested to see how his dynamic with zazie & co. unfolds given how insanely quick Wolfwood has taken a liking to Vash after speaking to him for about three minutes. even I was taken aback by the “So you can smile… You always smile so cheerfully but it's so empty. I can see you hurting.” Immediately followed by Vash asking him out on a date. There's so much homoeroticism between vashwood in the manga already and I've barely even started. I'm hoping season 2 of the anime picks up on these elements because I really do love their dynamic so much more now that I've read the manga. one last moment that stood out to me was in their last fight, where this rich girl is held hostage and she finds out her dad killed people and stole land for her to live the life she has.... and Vash hits her with <span style=color:#9a6aa9;font-style:italic>“I don't think you're stupid enough to ignore those on whom your life was built?”</span> Which is just such a great line. It made me take Vash a little more seriously (when I put my media analysis hat on) because I really wasn't resonating with the sacrificial vibes he had going on in the anime and the beginning of the manga. While I don't care what happens to that rich girl I am so looking forward to seeing how these thoughts grow along with Vash in Trigun Maximum!</p>

<p>but i'm a cheerleader!</p>
<img src=/images/library/cheerleader.png class=cover></a>
<p>i can't believe i hadn't watched this movie earlier! this is such a cute iconic lesbian movie, putting it right up there with D.E.B.S. it's really funny and silly but at the same time gives us such genuine and sweet moments about accepting yourself and being who you are. "there's not just one way to be a lesbian" truer words have never been spoken. god bless the old man yaoi and the short but sweet old woman yuri appearances in this movie. natasha's performance in this was incredible this is the first movie i've seen of her when she was younger. she was adorable! my one and only complaint (otherwise, it really would have been a perfect movie) is that the characters all seem to not know that trans people exist? poor jan really liked guys the whole time. jan was just a guy. but that thought didn't cross anyone's mind. at all. despite showing up with a buzz-cut and a mustache. i was a little disappointed that jan quit and was never seen again without getting her chance to have gender revelations the same way everyone else had sexuality revelations. but other than mishandling jan's character, i loved everything else about this movie. would totally recommend!</p>

<p>(rip to shion's face that got lost during the dithering process, lol) i re-watched this with my friend lola for the first time in years, and i fell in love with the series all over again. it's so unfortunate that you can't find this on any mainstream streaming platform.... you really have to know a guy who knows a guy to get your hands on this beautiful show. the main cast are such a lovable group of characters you really can't help but fall for every single one of them. i usually don't tend to enjoy the naive sheltered type, but shion is written in such a way that balances his privileged upbringing with these new truth of reality that nezumi sort of introduces him to. that was a werid way of saying what i meant but i'm too tired to be as thorough for this entry. i really love the political undertones to this story i thought it was a very well-done critique on capitalist and colonial power structures. the first and second time i watched this, i gave it a perfect 5 stars, but after this re-watch i was wondering with my friend if this had a manga series it was based off, and after quickly reading through the last few chapters we realized there was so much important content and a pretty big change in story that wasn't included in the anime. that alone made me knock it a point because i feel like the things that were missing from the anime were pretty important to the overall story and gave it more weight. so i was sad to see them fumble on that one. i do plan to read the manga from start to finish and pour over that more in-depth, so you'll probably see an entry later on the manga. overall i still have lots of love for no. 6, and i'm so excited to see how the manga differs from the anime...</p>

<p>trigun stampede</p>
<a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/52093/Trigun_Stampede?q=tri&cat=anime" target=_blank style=background-color:transparent><img src=/images/library/trigun.png class=cover></a>
<p>i just watched the last episode of trigun stampede and i'm currently feeling LOTS of emotions as i prepare to word vomit my thoughts on here (as i always do). this one has been especially popular lately.. i don't usually like watching shows that i'm seeing all over my twitter timeline because i hate having expectations for things, but trigun wiggled it's way out of every expectation in a way that was actually fun.<p>
<p>despite the first three episodes being a bit slow for me to get through, i was really drawn into the religious tones to the show. i am a sucker for characters that ramble incoherently about God which is what made Wolfwood end up one of my favorite characters from this series. he was my First favorite because of his character design and the fact that his introduction consisted of a) getting hit by a truck b) pretending to be a priest for Who knows why and c) "no matter how big of a cross you carry you still deserve to eat and to smile" which. is really insane. this man lives his life interacting with people while having absolutely no emotional intelligence and i think that's really enjoyable. i always love the freaks that make it clear they have absolutely no idea how to behave like a human being and have no intentions of starting now. this is wolfwood and i love it.</p>
<p>i wasn't <i>hooked</i> on the show until the wolfwood and livio childhood flashback episode (i think it was 6?). that was honestly probably the most brilliantly written flashback episode i have ever seen. the change in animation style and the lack of dialogue gave the memories such a raw feeling to them i think it is such a perfect way to make me care so much about a character who lives and dies in the same episode and also give so much emotional (?) depth to wolfwood in such a short amount of time and still make it meaningful. i loved it i love livio and i hope we somehow get more of him in the manga and/or in season 2...</p>
<p>i think my favorite part was how season one ended. i think during the last three episodes is when i really started to get what was going on between knives and vash and that's how i really fell in love with millions knives. what a fucking whack-job! i love him because there were so many instances throughout the series where i thought he almost had something going for him ideologically, in terms of human exploitation and liberation and things of that sort. it seems all he really wants is for vash to be by his side but he's just doing such a godawful job at convincing him to join his fight. nai so badly wants both worlds but has no actual plan to execute this. he really just thinks he can do whatever he wants and that vash will just follow along... because they are brothers. he is so out of touch, these type of guys are my favorite characters because it's so much fun to explore their fucked up thought processes. like. it's great that knives thinks manipulating vash's memories and decapitating the memory of his beloved mother is A Great Bonding Moment Actually. the fact that this actually makes sense to knives is so endearing. while none of his reasoning actually make sense, he clearly has put so much thought into why he does the things that he does and for his. i adore him.</p>
<p>what really got me was the final episode... the fight between vash and knives. i was already starting to get emotional about the army unloading their entire arsenal on vash while he's trying to protect them all... and im thinking wow this feels very biblical (i have not read the bible but im thinking i probably should at this point). then i'm hit with vash's single busted up angel wing and the whole thing starts feeling really sad. only to get hit AGAIN with knives pulling up with a busted up angel wing on the other side, so it's like if two halves made a whole and that really got to me. the fight was miserable from start to finish because they both were just desperately clawing at the other hoping that what they wanted in each other would reveal itself only for it to Not. i loved it because it was so... unproductive. it was so beautiful but so heartbreaking to see these two brothers who clearly still love each other but want the other to be something they're not. i live for fucked up family dynamics and especially when the family is as tight-knit as these twins. for them to have been so close but fall on opposite extremes of the spectrum of morality and humanity was so good. by that i mean i see vash as way too optimistic about humanity (he really does feel like an Angel at the end) that it costs him his own self-worth and sense of self. whereas nai is so pessimistic he just wants to kill god. a fallen angel perhaps.</p>
<p>i thought this series was really well done... so good that in fact i Will be starting the manga immediately after because my friend Cloud tells me we get more of some favorite characters of mine. so i am very much looking forward to that.</p>

<p>spider-man & venom: double trouble</p>
<img src=/images/library/spidervenom.png class=cover>
<p>stopped by the comic place on my way home from work today to pick up some spider-punk issues and i also randomly picked this out alongside it because the cover looked fun. i have seen this venom guy before but i haven't seen his movie or know anything else about him. so this right here is my first introduction to venom as a character and <i>boy</i> was it a great one. i'm sure venom is a much scarier villain when he's in more dramatic and intense situations but this super chill and funny setting was the Perfect way to introduce his character to me. i fell in love with the art style so fast and i felt it was so fitting for this kind of story. spidey and venom being roommates was so funny but also so cute and wholesome. i loved that they were actually friends. and gay. even though venom doesn't pay rent eats all his food and says things like "honey, i'm home!" spidey never kicks him out. which i think is really sweet. this also happened to be the most transgender work of fiction i've read in so long. and i'm being so serious. venom swapping bodies with spider-man so he can participate in what is essentially american ninja warrior because that is the only way he'd be allowed to do that. and the fact that moving around in spider-man's body came so naturally to him? he was so smooth and it felt natural to him meanwhile the spider-man in venom's body was clumsy and Struggling the whole time. that says a lot i think. the second body swap with the squirrel and the cat (which venom actually keeps as a pet...) was unexpected and so cute i loved every moment. seriously i can't think of anything bad to say about these issues i loved them so much. i love making mundane aus of any sort of intense dramatic story and these guys did all the work for me and wrapped it up in a beautiful fully colored package. it was amazing! i can't wait to read the rest of the spider-man comics i bought...<p>

<p>spider-man: across the spider-verse</p>
<img src=/images/library/atsv.png class=cover>
<p>i watched into the spider-verse when it first came out in theaters a few years ago, and i loved it a lot. i watched this one last night in theaters again. i got home and immediately <s>found it online for free and</s> watched it again because WOW. and today i just watched it for a third time with my friend. i guess you could say i loved this movie <i>a lot</i>... the animation was absolutely BEAUTIFUL i loved reading a few tweets here and there about how they animated hobie brown in particular (one of my favorites). i won't talk too much on the animation aspect because i don't know much about Animation but just know from my humble perspective it was SPECTACULAR. i loved the first half of the movie so much it was honestly perfect. i feel like i can't say much on the second half of the movie because all the thoughts i have right now rely on what happens in the second movie. i don't know anything about original spider-man lore so i am feeling a little behind.... but i am so invested and i've been so obsessed with this movie for the past 24 hours i feel like i should pick up the comics so i actually know what the fuck i'm talking about, you know?<p>
<p>(please take this with a grain of salt) but my thoughts so far on the movie are that i've read it in two ways. the first way (which i think is the main reading because i got this from my friend who knows a lot more about spider-man than i do, and this resonated with me the most) is that this movie is a commentary on the spider-man story itself, and how the writers and fan are so obsessed with this Canon storyline that the more you try to force characters into, the more watered down the character and story becomes. and miles our shining star is the spider-man that breaks the canon by doing what spider-man is supposed to do, save everyone. which contrasts miguel & co.'s insistence on sacrificing the few to save the many.. and miles breaking that canon is allowing for spider-man himself to have a more developed character and be more true to himself. regardless of whether that's right or not that's what i've gathered from it. and i like that.... idk i am feeling so nervous talking about spider-man like this because.... i hate being wrong about things and i know the chances are high because i haven't read the comics yet and since this movie is all about that i could be missing something huge... but whatever</p>
<p>oh i also wanted to add my thoughts following this on why gwen and peter were so awful to miles during this movie. not writing wise, as in they were awful friends to him. this may or may not be a hot take, i haven't seen anybody talk about this besides the 1am conversation i had with my friend lola on this. i think the way gwen and peter treated miles during the movie (leaving him out of spidey hq, standing there and doing nothing while miguel was beating the shit out miles, turning against him when he was forced to accept his dad's death) served to draw that distinction between characters who are "stuck" in the canon (gwen, peter, all the other spider-people) and those who break that canon (miles) (and also in a way, hobie and margo. i'll come back to these two later). what stood out to me was how hobie and margo both did more for miles than gwen and peter did in the whole movie, by teaching him to use his palms and by letting him go home. whereas gwen peter and miguel were all so hellbent on trying to morph miles into the spider-man they think he should be, the one that they believe is the true "canon" spider-man. which is not who he is! so i really liked that.</p>
<p>i don't think this alternative reading was intended but a lot of the scenes between miguel peter and miles about the sacrifices they <i>must</i> make and the pain they <i>must</i> endure made me think of generational trauma and cycles of harm. we saw jessica drew say things like "i made that mistake too, but i got over it" and miguel insisting that because he and all the other spider-people went through the trauma and pain of losing their dad, so did miles. and they sort of force this on him. to which miles points out how fucked up that is! instead of fighting for a universe where one spider-man doesn't have to go through that (which is actually exactly what miles does with pavitr! by saving that captain guy he not only breaks the Canon but he breaks that cycle of pain that every spider-man seems doomed to experience.. but pav is spared from that because of miles <i>saving everyone</i>), those guys continue that cycle of pain because it's the Canon... that "i went through this so you have to too" attitude made me think of the kinds of dynamics that occur between generations in families, which i thought was fun. i just wanted to write that down.</p>
<p>maybe i'll come back to this and add or edit stuff if i'm atrociously wrong about something after i read the comics and watch the next movie. that cliffhanger was insane and i can't believe they actually did that. i want to have complete thoughts on this incredible movie but it's hard when this is only half the story we started off with, so...</p>

<p>emergency declaration</p>
<img src=/images/library/ed.png class=cover>
<p>out of all the disaster movies like this i've seen before, this was actually the best of the best. i honestly think this should be like at the Top of whatever this genre of movie is. the way it was shot was sooooooo intense they were playing with my heart rate like a fiddle! i really liked the political aspect of the movie where they showed the US and Japan rejecting the people in the plane and the protests and stuff. and that one moment where the main little girl came to the adults about something (being vague to avoid spoilers lol) and all of the adults listened to her and believed her! which sounds a little silly to point out but it meant a lot to me. and it reminded me of this one <a href=http://whereareyouquetzalcoatl.com/mesofigurineproject/EthnicAndIndigenousStudiesArticles/Simpson2014.pdf target=_blank>Nishnaabeg story</a> i read for class a few semesters ago.. also, seeing the unnamed characters say their goodbyes to their families was so gut wrenching.... like Wow. it was so well done. i loved the movie a lot. i <i>do</i> think this story would be so much fun as a tv show. i just really think it would be cool to explore the Insane emotional rollercoaster of accepting death and then moments later being told you Won't be dying actually... like i'm sure that will fuck up people in many different ways.... a sort of Aftermath story would be cool to have for this movie if that makes sense...<p>

<p>the little mermaid</p>
<img src=/images/library/mermaid.png class=cover>
<p>ever since i saw they were doing a live action remake starring halle bailey of my favorite disney movie as a child i've been shivering in my timbers in excitement! fun fact when i was really young i would wake up extra early to watch the little mermaid on VCR and one day i wrote Ariel a letter and drew her a picture of herself to profess my love for her. so i thought it would be really smart for me to stuff my letter in with the VHS tape so that when i press play she would Receive my letter. little me thought this was a brilliant plan.. i broke the VCR and we never got it fixed... that's besides the point. i loved the casting for this movie so much, and i was surprised to find prince eric actually enjoyable in this movie! he was great. i didn't like his song so i took out 1/2 a star..... but that was like the only downside. so glad they made this movie... loved it so much.<p>

<p>the bear</p>
<img src=/images/library/thebear.png class=cover>
<p>THIS IS SUCH A GREAT SHOW. i originally saw a video edit a year ago with this guy yelling at everybody, and i loved this actor in shameless so my interest was piqued. however i could Not for the life of me find that edit again or the name of the show until 2 days ago, when i finally found it and binged the whole thing in 2 days. me personally, i LOVE getting emotionally manipulated by tv shows. and boy did this show play with my feelings like a fiddle! the bear does such a great job at building tension and making <i>me</i> feel like having a panic attack alongside carmen and dispelling it just like that. that was a poor attempt at explaining what i mean but whatever. i actually adore the whole cast. i'm serious when i say every single character (at the restaurant) is my favorite. the dialogue is so funny but when it gets real it gets <i>real</i>. and they do such a good job with making sure there's a balance. i am so excited for season 2 which is supposed to be coming soon. i need 5 seasons of this show at least i'm SO invested. and i'm dying to know what this BEAR means on a wider scale. it's only appeared in the first and last episode of season one and we learn that both carmen and his dead brother were called Bear....... i'm so interested i need more content to be able to have any substantial theories of whatever this bear really means besides the bear = carmen's issues. i just!!! so much joy and love in my heart for this show and everyone in it. season 2 soon!!!!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>update 10/9:</strong> i just realized i forgot to update this entry after watching season 2. it's keeping it's 5 stars this season was incredible. richie quickly moving up to be one of my favorite characters of all time, his arc this season was beautiful. i loved seeing sydney slowly lose her mind in the background of this season, and i can only hope this means she will be the focus for the next season. such an incredible series.</p>

<p>i feel like i'm definitely going to have to come back to this when i am more able to put my thoughts into better words. friends have been begging me to start succession for a year now but looking at this cover photo i really did not think i would like it..... i don't usually watch these business-y type shows, i just don't care for them. but BOY was i WRONG about succession. immediately, the first episode hooked me. i think what first drew me in was the funny dialogue and how the siblings acted like literal children. the contrast between how much power they hold and how they were literally tackling each other over something stupid was something i really enjoyed. the show is SO well done, from a technical standpoint. it seems like they had the CASH for this show and it paid off. i am a sucker for fucked up family dynamics and the roy family...... chefs KISS. most fucked up family i've seen on tv in a while. the ending was GREAT and so SATISFYING god i wish i had to words to express the feeling in my chest right now.... it was just so good and i'm so glad i finally watched it. i cant wait for when enough time has past so i can rewatch it again.<p>

<p>i watched this for the first time last week with my friend during our semi-frequent movie nights!! i felt like i just <i>had</i> to watch this movie at some point in my life, given it's a Classic and is referenced everywhere... and i ended up enjoying it a lot, which surprised me. i will say there was a part in the middle where i zoned out, which i guess means it wasn't that interesting to me but i really loved the concept and i see why everyone went nuts over this when it first came out. i love early 2000s movies about The Internet because they make me nostalgic and i am very interested in how people think of the internet both back in the day and also Now. and this movie itched that spot in my brain. the ending was perfect also i love how he just flew away.. because he Can do that. so silly!<p>

<a style=background-color:transparent target=_blank href=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/84/84-h/84-h.htm><img src=/images/library/frankenstein.png class=cover></a>
<p>i just finished volume one of frankenstien, and will update when i finish the rest. i was not expecting to love this as much as i do, and i am so... so in love with this story! here's a ramble of my thoughts so far: while i've only gotten a small glimpse of Walton so far, i do love that he is very much head over heals for Victor the moment they met. they do have so much in common! especially in the way they both adore their sisters. i hope the next volume has more letters from him i would like to know more about what he's like. victor is my favorite! well to be quite honest they're all my favorites right now (walton victor elizabeth justine.. the parallels).</p>
<p>i'm not sure if it's meant to be funny but I did want to laugh over how quick and dramatic victor's shift was once he Created the creature. i found the "His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as beautiful. Beautiful! Great God!" immediately followed by "A mummy again endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch." "...it became a thing such as even Dante could not have conceived" fucking hilarious. i do feel really bad for the creature like he didn't even do anything to be hated so much by his own Mother!!! speaking of. i am of the belief that Victor is a mother suffering from severe post-partum psychosis and depression. that's why he's like that. and says those things. i also really enjoyed his relationship with his Dear Friend Clerval i think they have something really special going on. there's this one excerpt is one of my favorites so far of the book:</p>
<blockquote style=text-align:justify>but Clerval called forth the better feelings of my heart; he again taught me to love the aspect of nature, and the cheerful faces of children. Excellent friend! how sincerely you did love me, and endeavour to elevate my mind until it was on a level with your own. A selfish pursuit had cramped and narrowed me, until your gentleness and affection warmed and opened my senses;</blockquote>
<p>i couldn't help but make the connection to <span style=background-color:black>satosugu</span> [redacted]. i hope nothing bad happens to them... i say this because i feel like as long as Victor keeps his secret and lets his abandoned creation run off.. it seems more bad things will happen. Victor is kind of a wuss but i still like him ♡ my favorite queer irresponsible bastard.my last thoughts for now are that i think justine and elizabeth should have kissed before justine died (i love them) i really liked the "Thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself." and how those exact words were used to describe Elizabeth masking her own grief for the sake of keeping her family happy. they both just get each other so much. and don't get me started on Elizabeth's last words to her... truly a miserable world it would be without Justine...</p>
<p><strong>volume 2 update: </strong>I've been speeding through this so fast (I'm just so into this) I forgot to take a moment after finishing volume 2 to write about it... so this will be a shorter entry than the first. until i get inspired and want to write more about it later.</p>
<p>Victor is really starting to piss me off! Stand up! He is being very woe is me right now, but I will say some of (all of, if we're being serious) these lines are just so beautiful. "Thus not the tenderness of friendship, nor the beauty of earth, nor of heaven, could redeem my soul from woe: the very accents of love were ineffectual." I really liked that one. It's especially interesting considering how Victor desperately tries to ease his soul and find crumbs of happiness when he's surrounded by nature, but even that won't work now. Victor reminds me of all the miserable whiny depressed narrators / main characters in some other things I've read (reminding me a lot of the unnamed narrator from Season of Migration to the North by Tayeb Salih right now). If he thinks he's miserable, wait til he hears the creature's lived experiences!</p>
<p>I was seriously almost brought to tears twice while reading the creature's story on the train it was so devastating. The creature is literally just a little guy. If Victor hadn't been such a bully and shown him kindness literally none of this would have happened but whatever man. #Don'tJudge. What I love is that the creature has enough reasons right now to be truly evil and kill everyone but he's STILL giving Victor a chance to redeem all of humanity and give him a Frankenshorty. All he wants is companionship and Victor won't even give him that! Who is the real agent of evil and cruelty? I am going to be such a nerd about this and say this part of the creature's dialogue when he says:</p>
<blockquote style=text-align:justify>'You are in the wrong,' replied the fiend; 'and, instead of threatening, I am content to reason with you. I am malicious because I am miserable. Am I not shunned and hated by all mankind? You, my creator, would tear me to pieces, and triumph; remember that, and tell me why I should pity man more than he pities me? You would not call it murder, if you could precipitate me into one of those ice-rifts, and destroy my frame, the work of your own hands.'</blockquote>
<p>really reminded me of Meruem's dialogue with Netero in Hunter X Hunter... it was definitely inspired by this it had to have been. Maybe! I can't help but make connections like these. I personally believe Victor should suffer more! I am glad the stars and the heavens that once comforted him now mock him forever! I'll maybe come back with a more thoughtful analysis if I am feeling upto it, there is a lot to be said about responsibility, care, and community from this text, and I'm excited to read the last volume and see how this all ends.</p>
<p><strong>volume 3 update / final thoughts: </strong>i'm keeping this one shorter because i am on the train and don't feel like writing a lot about this right now but. i loved this book so much. i already want to reread it. the Creature's last words really touched my heart i'm still in awe over how beautifully this was all written... "You hate me, but your abhorrence cannot equal that with which I regard myself"... "My spirit will sleep in peace, or if it thinks, it will not surely think thus. Farewell."... absolutely beautifully devastating. this is going on my Hall Of Fame of books, it's that good. I'm so glad i read this..</p>

<p>the sucker by elle shivers</p>
<a style=background-color:transparent target=_blank href=https://elleshivers.com/The-sucker><img src=/images/library/thesucker.png class=cover></a>
<p>Wah! I am so glad I impulse bought this comic from one of my favorite artists. They draw a lot of fanart that I adore, so I was so psyched to see they have their own works published as well! The Sucker was such a beautiful read, beautifully, literarily, in all the ways. I loved the tense dynamic between the two main friends (EJ and Dani, I believe) the most. Getting those glimpses of their past when they swam together and seeing the way they sort of left off, only to reunite again with all those Complicated feelings about each other really touched me! My chest is full of feelings I can't really explain right now, I just know that it's a good thing. I am truly obsessed with this and I am so glad I got the opportunity to read such a tale. I totally recommend this to literally everyone (and you can click on the cover image to be directed to their site to buy the book)! ♡</p>

<p>i don't ever seek out a comedy show because i just don't find them that funny but abbott elementary is the exceptional exception. this show is hilarious! every single episode has me a-kekekeing and heheheing (ﾉ≧∀≦)ﾉ my favorite duo is barbara and melissa, but the character who makes me laugh the most is definitely ava. i love that it's in a school setting too, since i am thinking about becoming a teacher maybe... mimimimi. making as completed cause the first season is over, but I'm so excited to see what next season will bring. 5 trillion stars!<p>

<p>DARK</p>
<a style=background-color:transparent target=_blank href=https://dark.netflix.io/en><img src=/images/library/dark.png class=cover></a>
<p>i love tv shows that function as if they are puzzles. DARK is so different from all the other time travel shows i've seen, and they play with the concept in such a unique way! it's a bit tragic but also perfect in a way. the writing is incredible, especially in the first two seasons and I truly appreciate how the ending of the series wraps up so nicely. because it's one of those shows where Everything Matters and all the details Mean Something i'm sure I missed a lot, but that's okay. This is a show that was made to be re-watched so I'm excited to do that later on. the casting for this show is actually insanely good. the directors must have sold their souls to find other actors who looked so much like each other to play their older/younger selves. it's really impressive. almost scary. the soundtrack is really great too, i've added <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMHLkcc9I9c">Irgendwie Irgendwo Irgendwann</a> by NENA to my own playlist. i will say that i enjoyed season 3 a lot less than i did the rest. i wouldn't say it's bad or lacking in quality compared to the first two seasons, i just personally couldn't get into the new World concept. i think the show was already so dense (I liked that) but this new layer was just too much for my little brain. but again, i don't think it was like worse than the others. the writing was just as good and the ending was also nice neat and fitting. i loved it. it just took me forever to get through the last season..</p>

<a style=background-color:transparent target=_blank href=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/673386/thistlefoot-by-gennarose-nethercott/><img src=/images/library/jm.png class=cover></a>
<p>i read this entire book in one sitting yesterday. i read along with the audiobook CDs i got after seeing jennette speak at my school a few weeks ago. i usually don't enjoy reading memoirs (they bore me) but this is the exception to that. my God was it the most beautifully written work i've read in a while. i simply could not put it down. it was so immersive and emotional (i did tear up a little towards the end...) but also so funny at times. her story is so important and resonated with me in ways i didn't think it would. i honestly think Anyone no matter what books they like to read would enjoy this. so much love in my heart for jennette i am so happy for her and how far she's come. her experiences with the Healing process is something i hold dear to my heart. ah! just such a good book.</p>

<p>i had initially started reading this because i saw a lot of funny panels where the dialogue looked really silly, but i'm almost caught up now and i genuinely love this series. it's so very intense but the characters are all so loveable and crazy and i love all the portrayals of the different ways to love soccer. it's really fun. i'm probably misleading a few people by describing blue lock in such a wholesome way but it really is a sweet treat for me. my favorite players are shidou, rin, and isagi. and bachira too. but (more importantly) my favorite character dynamics are whatever rin and isagi & also shido and itoshi got going on. i just love it when it's the two characters that seem the most different that end up being the best matches for each other. it's also not that common i care so much about the main character but isagi i am rooting for you! you crazy little boy! いけ いけ いさぎ !<p>

<p>i impulsively bought this book during my last trip to my local bookstore because i was very curious about this house with chicken legs... it took me a while to get through the book because the pacing was too slow for me to stay hooked for too long. i considered putting it on pause and reading something else for a bit, but i am really glad i didn't do that. i loved the story it had to tell! i am a big fan of stories about stories and generational tales and this book was very much that. plus it was the first time reading a story based in Jewish folklore and I really loved it. isaac was my favorite character, and his past with benji was very fun to read about. i love the way the ending was told.. i'm really attached to that house. overall, a good read. i think i would have got through it sooner if i could listen along to the audiobook, but i couldn't find it anywhere for free... </p>

<p>swarm</p>
<a style=background-color:transparent target=_blank href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_(TV_series)><img src=/images/library/swarm.png class=cover></a>
<p><strong>update (04-02-2023):</strong> a friend told me apparently it's not based on real events at all really and i was tricked by the internet again. which means i can give it a star rating heheee. i feel so silly but i'll keep up my insane little rant below because although my larger ideas might not apply to swarm anymore, i think i make good points in general. i feel strangely embarrassed but also its okay because who cares</p>
<p>i think Swarm was beautifully crafted and the acting was incredible. however. the more i think and talk about this show the more i am bothered by this strange feeling i have about what this show actually is. it's hard to describe but it feels a little lost in it's purpose. watching the show, it really feels like it's a fiction thriller show (despite it saying "this is not fiction" in the beginning of every episode), but it's not. now, i don't know much about the actual events this show is based on, but i know it is based on both real life events and rumors, calling itself Not Fiction. this really bothers me. i worry about what it means to take real life events and portray them in a way that feels? fictional? hm. i feel like i'm not doing a great job of expressing what i mean. this just didn't feel as serious as it was, i feel, supposed to be. when reading this show as a non-fiction piece, it feels like another one of those serial killer documentary that glamorizes and makes a spectacle of real killers. which is not great. it also makes me feel weird as a viewer, enjoying what feels like a fun Fictional thriller, and then remembering that this is not fictional and real people were hurt by these events. this is the biggest issue i have with the show, and this exactly is also what makes its commentary on stan culture feel really shallow. now, if this was indeed fiction, i wouldn't mind the shallow commentary because this show doesn't feel like it was that serious to begin with. it's really artistic and beautiful and emotionally engaging and visually appealing, but i think it was missing the more serious undertones it needs. like, those serial killer documentaries are <i>documentaries</i>, so (despite those shows being terrible and incredibly harmful) at least you would know what you're going into before you start watching.</p>
<p>maybe i'm totally wrong and stupid about this. but i just think this kind of uncertainty? whatever the missing piece is here that's bugging me so much.. is really important to have and without it i feel like it can send weird messages to viewers who are struggling enough with media literacy today. idk man.... the implications are weird. i feel weird!</p>

<p>the last of us (season 1)</p>
<a style=background-color:transparent target=_blank href=https://www.hbo.com/the-last-of-us><img src=/images/library/tlou.png class=cover></a>
<p>after watching the entire first season what i have to say is: man this show is just so beautifully written. and amazingly produced. i think the scene in the season finale where joel is killing everyone in the hospital but the audio is muffled almost like you're putting your hands over your ears was so powerful to me. chefs kiss absolutely brilliant. that will stick with me forever. the worldbuilding is just so cool. i've been seeing side by side comparisons of the show and the game and i am so impressed by how true to the source material they are. i haven't played the games but i know many who have and they all have told me that even though they know what will happen they are still hooked and excited to see what each episode brings. i love joel ellie so much. best duo to ever duo.</p>

<p>every single scream movie</p>
<img src=/images/library/scream.png class=cover>
<p>i have taken it upon myself to watch every single scream movie in a row, and i will compile my little Thoughts all into one post because having 6 boxes on SCREAM feels insane. plus i don't think i'll have much to say on each individual one. we'll see though.</p>
<p><strong>(3/8/23) scream 1:</strong> loved it. too many breaking 4th wall jokes about Horror Movie Structure <i>but</i> the scene where that nerd guy was like "behind you!" and the freaks in the van were watching him and screaming "behind you!" was really funny.</p>
<p><strong>(3/10/23) scream 2:</strong> i see that the fourth wall thing is a Bit now. i get it. it's fun i do enjoy it now a lot more. i started to get bored halfway though because i just don't care about dewey and Monica (who i know is not actually named monica). but then the end got exciting again. even though i wasn't a fan of the killers this time. felt like something was missing...</p>
<p><strong>scream 3:</strong> what is sid's kill count at this point my god! they can't let her keep getting away with this!!!!</p>
<p><strong>(3/11/23) scream 4:</strong> alright we're starting to pick up. better than 3, pretty good. i did get a little bored halfway through tho. again. i loved emma roberts though. i think i would have disliked this one a lot more without her performance. she carried!!!</p>
<p><strong>scream 5:</strong> i think this one might be my favorite so far. i suddenly care more about dewey and monica now. i've started to love the movie structure monologues they do every time it makes me feel like i'm taking film 101. amber has been my favorite killer so far besides the originals i'd say. the fact that it's all in the same house is a detail i loved. ugh! everything was done so much better.</p>
<p><strong>scream 6:</strong> an incredible movie!!! i'm so glad i got to see this one in theaters. i absolutely love the killers in this one, the acting was incredible and tbh i supported them! i'll be vague to avoid spoilers since this one is so new, but ahh!!! the twist?! so good. i totally didn't see you-know-who coming back. and then the thing!!! and then he made it!!!!! wow. haha. 5/5. my official ranking as of my Feelings right now are 1, 4+5 all tied for first. then its 4, 2, and then 3. what a great franchise. <s>scream7 now!!!!!!!!!!</s></p>

<p>i love how adorable this show is. i did enjoy the first season a lot more than the second. especially towards the end with the yue Development and also just getting more growth out of sakura and li. i feel like the pacing was just more to my liking than it was in the second season. but!! i didn't <i>dislike</i> season 2 or anything, it's super cute and i am living for all the yukino and tomoya moments... (the best part of the entire series tbh) they mean so much to me (´｡• ω •｡`) ♡</p>

In the collage the woman is meant to represent Warda, and the frame plays an important role in how I understand how Omar sees her. Omar finds enchantment through the feelings of “longing, anticipation, the titillation of adventure” rather than Warda herself, which is why she is the center of attention in the collage but still confined within the frame (43). While he still looks to her for what he feels is missing form his monotonous life, it is ultimately not enough for Omar. He always wants what lies beyond the golden frame. The cut outs of the birds, the spaceship, and the banana with half a face to reflect the surrealism present in Omar’s narration.</p><p style=text-align:center>collage depicting warda from <i>the beggar</i> by naguib mahfouz</p><br>

<p>hello i'm sabrin aka rin aka weenie. i'm a twenty something year old compsci & sociology major :)</p>
<p>i have been super nostalgic for the old internet, so after stumbling across the <a style=color:#6faa00 href=https://yesterweb.org/ target=_blank>yesterweb</a> directory i realized i could just make my own site! like this one! personal webpages like this feel like a breath of fresh air compared to commercialized and uncustomizable social platforms. my favorite part about having my own site is that i can redesign it whenever i feel like it... and when people interact with my site it feels so much more genuine than regular social media interactions feel.</p>
