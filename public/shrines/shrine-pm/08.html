    <p>this was the album that made me realize how much more expensive japanese releases are in k-pop. crazy. i did appreciate that this also came with a DVD! which i actually didn't watch until literally today (and i've had this for a couple years... i just didn't have a DVD player until recently) which is funny. the DVD was like an episode of one of those videos where they have the girlies do sports and activities like tug-a-war and stuff at some gym. just gals havin' fun. except this had no subtitles so i didn't understand a word they were saying. hula hoops were thrown! and hooped! and such.</p>
