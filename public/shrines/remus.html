She likes to climb onto high places (to establish dominance and superiority) and plays with her toys <img style="float: right; margin: 10px;" src="https://graphic.neocities.org/tumblr_me9z6qxy341rpa4ggo3_100.gif"> by pawing on them AND she also bathes herself <em>she's so hygenic!!! world's first muslim dog!!!!</em> (wow remus you really are como un gato!!!!) although i have never met remus in real life (YET...... as of january 2023 to be exact) (i will meet her one day) (and flo too) i love remus a lot. she is clearly the cutest pup you have ever seen and the fact that she doesn't know how to act like a dog makes her the best dog in the world. an icon, truly.
