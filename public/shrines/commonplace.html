        <p>i'm giving up pretending to be a mother. in the end, i never once managed to genuinely feel like a mother.<br><br>i never should have had children. i should have stayed alone. my mistake was thinking everything would change. i'd have a child, and pour all the love i never received into it. and then... and then i'd be redeemed... i'd be redeemed. that's what i thought when i got pregnant. but at the same time, i wondered whether i should really be having a baby. i thought maybe it would be better to get an abortion. even after the baby was born, i kept thinking about it. wondering whether i shouldn't have had one after all.<br><br>i mean, in the end, i wasn't redeemed at all. i'd been wrong. it's time to get rid of him. to get rid of my child. i can now, can't i? now that he's murdered someone. ahh, i can finally be by myself. my life is about to begin.</p>
