<div class="content">
    <p><img src="/assets/04-blog/2026-horse.gif" style="float: left;">happy third birthday to sabrin.party! i missed it again this year. one year i will remember it on time and maybe even, if the stars align, do something fun for my website's birthday. i always <i>want</i> to do or make something fun for january 14th sabrin.party birth, but this is a very busy and stressful time of year for me so i always forget it. maybe one day...</p>
    <p>it's crazy to think i've had this website for three years now. it's grown so much! my digital baby. it's changed a lot over the years, even though my knowledge of computer science and coding has changed very little. funny how that works out.</p>
    <p>currently watching daniel hentschel's latest video on how <a href="https://inv.nadeko.net/jUZUrtV2bWc?__goaway_challenge=meta-refresh&__goaway_id=e3788a749ebec29ecfe06ee797cf3024&__goaway_referer=https%3A%2F%2Finv.nadeko.net%2Fwatch%3F__goaway_challenge%3Djs-refresh%26__goaway_id%3Dd8d9672c471ffa32405851522c5c7e80%26__goaway_referer%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Finv.nadeko.net%252F%26v%3DjUZUrtV2bWc&t=2" target="_blank">we are all constantly getting scammed</a> by the dentist mafia (dental insurance) and it's so relatable. until next time...</p>

<div class="content" id="#010126">
    <p>happy new year 2006! i did a lot this year, even if it feels like i haven't done anything. i graduated college. i watched a lot of tv. and read quite a few books. and i even went outside quite a bit! i started taking photos of birds. and i'm sure i did more i'm just forgetting. who cares. new year means it's time for my media wrapped! i honestly have so much fun making these. i even stopped playing <i>1000xRESIST</i> (which i am obsessed with, by the way) so i could finish & upload this tonight. as usual, if the text is too small to read (which it might be) click on the image to open full size in a new tab. enjoy my journey through escapism-central!</p>

    <p>despite all odds, i managed to get myself all the way to ohio to celebrate my two beautiful friends' wedding/nikkah ceremony! i am still reeling after the past three? four? days of so much fun and love and joy. i met so many of yousuf & isabella's friends and i loved them all so much i consider them my new best friends now. it's insane how much love i feel for this bunch. everyone is so smart and cool and interesting and kind! i'm tearing up a little typing this out.</p>

    <p>this journal entry will mostly be a photo-dump. i don't know how i feel about posting my face on here, but it's whatever for now. i want to etch this moment into sabrin.party because i am sabrin.party and i make (and break) the rules here.</p>

    <p>i had so much fun getting to talk to and know my new best friends. i loved talking to mani who is my twin for real? we are so similar and they clocked me crazystyle twice that night, it was hilarious and a little scary. we both can't wait to be in our 70s (if you get it you get it) and we both run grapheneOS on our phones and are disco elysium fans and these things seem little but they are important to me. i will not explain myself here. but mani is such a cool person. and so was everyone at my table and the other table, which after a thrilling conversation with yezen we determined is the slightly less woke table. (not serious) (just in a jokey way). i have to move to ohio.</p><audio controls style="width: 100%;"><source src="/assets/04-blog/2025-desigirl.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio>

    <p>i spent the night straight up yapping everyone's ear off about god knows what. i know i plugged tshirt3000's <a href="https://longposter.neocities.org/yaoi" target="_blank">yaoi zines</a> and the <a href="https://americanfujo.itch.io/american-fujo" target="_blank">american* fujo*</a> journal several times... i can't help myself. yaoi studies is my passion. i was so happy talking to everyone. i lost my voice from talking so much. and speaking of yaoi studies, i got everyone to watch <i>heated rivalry</i> with me. and i ended up watching that show a total of four times over in that house. i am a beast. i cannot be contained. except for when i am.</p>

    <p>i need to talk about how much i loved queer fight night (fight night one night only in cincinnati, ohio don't miss it). genuinely the most fun i've had watching people do anything in my life. i sadly missed the first few fights when i was on my hour long odyssey with lake in the freezing cold, but! i made it in time to watch nicoletta and magz duke it out and it was so awesome. the two qualifications to enter is to be intoxicated and/or queer in some way. and the goal is to pin the other person on their back for five seconds without getting off your knees. it's so fun. i should have joined. i don't know why i didn't.</p>

    <p>last day in ohio! that morning we went to isabella's family's house for brunch which was so lovely. i loved meeting isabella's parents and hanging out with her siblings! they're so kind. after brunch we picked up coffee at <i>coffee emporium</i> which was so yummy... and then it was time to say our goodbyes. but then... i missed my flight! so i came back and we watched more <i>heated rivalry</i> until around 2am and i fought sleep until around 4am so i could leave for my flight home... i miss everyone already. probably the best weekend of my life i only wish i was there longer.</p>
    <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/fTV38BD5/2025-yousabella07.jpg" title="bonus: pixel fujos out with me" alt="pixel, grey kitten, sitting on my lap and watching heated rivalry with me" style="width: 100%;">
    <p>last thing i wanted to mention: pixel is catherine's kitten, she's adorable and i was so surprised she took a liking to me so fast. when i was watching <i>heated rivalry</i> in the living room while everyone else in the house was busy with pickups and other errands, she jumped up on my lap and seemed genuinely interested in what was going on on the tv. so naturally i took to explaining the plot and yaoi dynamics to her for a while. it was so adorable. i love you pixel, thanks for fujoing out with me.</p>

<button id="101025" type="button" class="collapsible"><time>2025-10-10</time>: long diary entry, it's been a while</button>
<div class="content">
    <p>dear diary,</p>
    <p>long time no type! it's been the whole summer, a hectic one at that. my month spent in morocco (and paris! for a week) was great, i only wish i got to spend more time in morocco. unfortunately one month of morocco time is not enough to see my entire family and i missed a couple cousins this time... oh well. exploring paris was fun, and i'm glad i went even though i have great disdain for the country and it's people... <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoration_of_the_Shepherds_with_a_Donor" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/04-blog/2025-louvre.webp" style="float: right; padding-left: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 5px;" class="hover" title="adoration of the shepherds with a donor by palma vecchio"></a>i'm so glad i got to see the louvre and most importantly... armand in the louvre! for the <i>interview with the vampire</i> fans... you understand this was my mona lisa. which was funny because this painting was in the same room as the mona lisa. i also got to have a lovely cup of hot cocoa in <i>les deux magots</i>, which i'm sure has some sort of historical significance but i only know it as the place with the best cocoa that arthur from <i>the amelia project</i> is obsessed with. and he's right, it is the best hot cocoa i've ever had!</p>
    <p>coming home from my summer vacation was not as restful and relaxing as i wanted it to be. when i got home i had to host more family for two more weeks, and after they left we got yet another guest. the final boss, the most stressful guest of all. one of my cousins was supposed to go to university here but he had no plan and sort of just expected me to handle everything for him including his absurdly high tuition. why i was suddenly assigned the job of being this kid's father? i will never know but i was stressed for an entire month dealing with the drama of having an inconsiderate teenage son in. i don't really blame him nor am i mad at him but it was really difficult to live with. really got me thinking about the way boys are often raised to be incompetent because of the expectation that everyone else will serve and support and carry them for their entire lives. i refused to do this, naturally.</p>
    <p>now that i finally have a home to myself i've been starting my graduate school applications which are really stressing me out because i am awful at making myself sound interesting on paper. i know i am an interesting person and would be a great fit for these schools but when i try to say anything about myself in written form i sound so cliche and boring. personal statements are my greatest enemy. i also am struggling with this because i do my best thinking when i'm talking to another person, hence why i learn so much more in a classroom than i do when i try to do independent learning, and it just feels so imposing to ask a friend to sit down with me and help me talk through Myself. sighs. i've also been looking for library jobs for the Library Experience and so i don't feel like i've completely wasted my gap year. wish me luck!</p>
    <p>i want to get into regular journaling, i've been trying to get myself to be Bored more often. i'll let you know if i end up following through with this or not. limiting my never-ending access to the internet, trying to wean myself off the instant gratification slop content i usually put on in the background and instead watching and listening to things that are more meaningful to me. it's hard though, and i've said this about a bajillion times in my life. but i've definitely made a little progress over the past five years! it's a slow process. but i sometimes worry about myself and my brain, especially as i start to feel really dumb the longer i go without school, so i want to put more effort into becoming more of a human. here's a cool video, as a treat:</p>

    <p>last blog entry i made a list of things i hoped to accomplish. let's see what i managed to complete over the summer.</p>
    <ul><li>revamp physical media shrine. <a href="https://sabrin.party/shrines/physicalmedia" target="_top" class="bloglink">i did it!</a> take a look at the music & movies i got lyin' around my room.</li>

<button id="062225" type="button" class="collapsible"><time>2025-06-22</time>: to-do list</button>
<div class="content">
    <p>this is my to-do list of <a href="index.html" class="bloglink">sabrin.party</a> related things i want to accomplish before the summer ends:</p>
    <ul><li>completely re-do my physical media shrine. i don't like the way i set it up and it's way too much work to update. speaking of,<img src="/assets/04-blog/2025-13wtbos.webp"style="float: right; padding-left: 15px;"> i randomly picked up this cd album <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8kkr_UaUug&list=PLYMu7I1rsdOkH1UG_iR3DNtsU4gQxU0i6" target="_blank" class="bloglink">13 ways to bleed on stage</a> by <i>cold</i> that i really liked based on the cover and cd design alone. i put it on and this album actually fucks! i was pleasantly surprised. </li>
    <li>update my podcast shrine that i abandoned because i was too lazy to write about the rest of the podcasts i like.</li>
    <li>(this one is more wishful thinking) optimize this site? i am aware of the fact that it is not actually Built Well at all. i should fix the code that is probably redundant and not using the best of practices... put that quarter of a computer science degree to use, future me!</li>
    <li>revamp the bird shrine to look more photobook esque so i can upload my higher quality bird photos (i bought a new fancy camera so i can take actual photos of beautiful birds!) i'm still learning how to use this camera, but here's the best photo i've taken so far. that's a pretty cool waxwing if i've ever seen one.</li></ul>
    <img src="/assets/04-blog/2025-birb.webp" style="width: 100%;">
    <p>i think that's it actually... random thought time before i log off and go to bed. this is now a diary entry. right now i'm thinking about what to make for yaoi zine 6. i feel so dead no ideas are coming to me but hopefully something inspires me before the deadline closes. i'm thinking of <i>harrow the ninth</i> and how much i adore harrowhark and her weird neurotic behaviors that remind me of myself and also not relatable to me at all. tamsyn muir's character writing is phenomenal. this series has been making me feel insane (in a good way) lately. i'm thinking about odyssus, just like. in general. i am loving <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3HvgaZeBWbr7UjFeicPFRI" target="_blank" class="bloglink">epic: the musical</a> right now, which is a musical adaptation of <i>the odyssey</i>. which, like, duh! of course it should be sung! i think this musical is much more pro-odysseus (propaganda! lol) than i expected, but i'm not mad about it. i can think odysseus is a bitch and also love him at the same time. i reread a bit of the odyssey before i lent my copy to carlea (to ruin her life). i'm going to go play hades on my phone until i fall asleep for real. <i>it's an ancient greek summer babeyy!</i> i'm so sleepy i'm probably deleting half of this by morning. good night, internet. </p>
</div><br><br>
<button id="033025" type="button" class="collapsible"><time>2025-03-30</time>: i graduated!</button>
<div class="content">
    <img src="/assets/04-blog/2025-graduated.webp" style="margin: 0 auto; margin-top: 20px;">
    <p>after <s>four</s> five long years of writing papers and crying over exams, major changes and life crises, i finally graduated! yay me! i was filled with dread and anxiety the night before and morning of my graduation, but everything ended up going well. i now have a bachelor's degree. in sociology. that i probably won't use. but who cares! i'm not done with school. if i can afford it, i plan to go to library school (getting a master's degree in library sciences) and once i'm there, hopefully, figure out how to become an archivist. that's what i really want.</p>
    <p>graduating means a lot of people asking me what i'm going to do with my life. to which i say, i don't know! lalalalala! i literally have no idea what i'm doing at any point in time. i'm zero days old, it's my first life, i'm new here, i don't know anything. so we'll see where i end up. i'm starting to understand why people in the movies always dread visiting their parents during the holidays. except i live with mine all the time so i'll be praying for my own sanity moving forward.</p>
    <p>i guess i'm pretty proud of myself. i'm trying to be positive about this and not think too hard about how this degree might have been a huge waste of time and money. but what's done is done and i'm pretty sure i did a fine job. i'm nervous about my gap year and applying to grad school, but that's something i will be stressing about in the fall. oh man...</p>

<button id="041725" type="button" class="collapsible"><time>2025-04-17</time>: let geto suguru eat people</button>
<div class="content">
    <p>i haven't thought about <i>jujutsu kaisen</i> in so long but i was reading this chapter on dark shamanisms for one of my classes (<a target="_blank" class="bloglink" href="/assets/04-blog/2025-Fausto-BlendofBloodandTobacco-2004.pdf">"A Blend of Blood and Tobacco"</a>) and i kept finding myself being reminded of geto suguru in the post-hidden inventory arc we never got to see... in short, the reading is about the parakanã, a small population of southeastern amazonian people. it talks about how shamanism is very stigmatized because its heavily associated with predatory imagery and warfare. at the same time, shamans are the only people who are, and i quote, <i><span class="quote">capable of extracting the pathogenic agents that cause diseases, known as karowara.</span></i> hello geto suguru. my favorite guy who also happens to extract [cursed] spirits via consumption...</p><img src="/assets/04-blog/2025-jjkrant01.webp" width="100%"><p>the reading also talked about this association between <i><span class="quote">eating the jaguar's food</span></i> and cannibalism that got me thinking about a fun little alternate universe situation where everything in jujutsu kaisen remained the same except for the fact that geto's cult also happened to engage in cannibalism. i just think that would be neat. everybody's geto characterization needs to get darker NOW!!!!!!!!</p>
    <p>i really liked this one part they described where the shaman would drink blood and then throw it up for some rituals, and then when the ritual is over they smoke tobacco to cleanse. and, you know, usually i am so anti-smoker geto. i think the sugushoko yuri is so much stronger that geto keeps a lighter on him at all times to light shoko's cigs when he himself has never smoked a day in his life. however, i absolutely love the idea of him not starting to smoke until after he organized his cult and started performing The Rituals. there was a line that was like tobacco smoke is used to cleanse the shaman's body from the smell of blood they consume from their rituals. and given the bloody nature of <i><span class="quote">his blue spring of youth</span></i>, i love this concept of. Cleanse. for him. his shower scene. you know?</p>

    <img src="/assets/04-blog/2025-jjkrant02.webp" width="100%"><p>geto's <s>cursed </s>faithful spirit manipulation technique. i just love how this excerpt so perfectly aligns with what his main cursed technique is all about.
    </p><p style="text-align: center;">•·················•·················•</p>
    <p>speaking of how suguru has infamously coped with the horrors of his childhood, i sometimes like to think of his radicalization as also a spiritual awakening. a transformation. i was yet again reminded of geto as i read this part of the chapter that talked about about jaguar symbolism in this cosmology and how it's represented as a <i><span class="quote">metamorphosis</span></i>. and <i><span class="quote">an alteration of point<img src="/assets/04-blog/2025-jjkrant03.webp" style="float: right; width: 170px; padding-left: 5px; padding-top: 5px;"> of view</span></i>. i got a flashback of the pivotal moment gojo relied on geto to guide his moral compass. did you? now you have.</p>

    <p><i><span class="quote">will i make my aunt for her family cry with my spotted skin.</span></i> suguru going back to his home village but to massacre them all anakin-style, but also. that song just reminded me of the feeling of isolation.. of being misunderstood after going through such a transformation like he did. and that one conversation with shoko where he was like <i><span class="quote">i guess i'm just testing my luck.</span></i>. unsure if she'd ever want to see him again.</p><p>earlier in the reading, they talk about how shamanism is very stigmatized despite having all these healing powers because of how they are also capable of terrible violence. a huge part of geto's whole deal post-radicalization that he's like, we go through so much shit and no one even values our gross disgusting horrifying work. so he ends up living a life where he is a healer and collector of faithful enemies on one hand, and also commits acts of mass murder on halloween night.</p><p>so there's mention of this man who went to a village shaman because he had trouble walking and recorded and transcribed the healing ritual. <i><span class="quote">curing as a form of hematophagy</span></i>.  consuming the blood your flesh rejects as a healing technique. it made me think of suguru talking about how he is the only one who knows how curses taste like, like towels soaked in vomit. <i><span class="quote">exorcise, ingest, consume.</span></i> what a toll. i also feel like this bloodier vision of geto opens up more interactions and Exploration of his potential relationship with choso which i would have loved to see... especially since kenjaku aka suguru's body snatcher is literally choso's fathermother. i feel like we could do something with that.</p><p>anyways, that's all. let suguru eat people.</p>

<div class="content">
    <p>do you remember the nickelodeon worldwide day of play? i remember it fondly... whether or not you'd actually play or just switch to disney channel doesn't matter too much i guess, but i really like the idea of shutting down The Party™ once a week. to get myself to stop fiddling with this thing every day, but also for any potential visitors to take a break for the web every now and then. the internet is a fun place to be, but i also find the idea of little ol' me telling you to go outside very amusing. i guess i'm trying to bring a sense of tangible reality into my digital home by limiting it's access, in a sense? it's not the end of the world if you stumble upon my site and see that you gotta wait until tomorrow to access. what happened to the art of waiting?</p>

    <p>anyways, i've had this zz plant (i think!) for about three years now and i'll be honest. i don't know how to care for this thing. i water it when it needs to, but i haven't repotted it.. at all... but it's still alive! i hadn't given up on it, but i was weary of it's survival until i noticed this new sprout growing in strong! which has inspired a new hope in my plant care abilities. so i will definitely be repotting it this spring. sorry zz, i will take better care of you moving forward...</p>

<button id="012225" type="button" class="collapsible"><time>2025-01-22</time>: meditation? maybe?</button>
<div class="content">
    <p>i realized that i <i>never</i> spend any time alone with myself. ever. only recently, the exception has been when i go for a walk with the kid i babysit, and that was the only time i existed without my music or my phone to distract me. but i wanted to start meditating. i feel a little silly writing this out loud, but seeing tons of videos of david lynch talking about how meditation helped him be happier and more creative really inspired me. i've been reading his book, <i>catching the big fish</i> recently and i just resonate so hard with so much of what he says (so much of it is things i've said before to my friends) and i feel like i might as well see if this meditation thing will be for me. no matter, i think it's just good for me to be able to exist with myself without distraction or noise. i just feel like it's good for my brain! i feel like i need to be able to do it.</p>
    <p>so i meditated for ten minutes this morning. i didn't look up any guides i don't know if i want any. i just closed my eyes and sat mostly still for ten minutes. and it wasn't as painfully boring as i thought it was going to be. i day dreamed a bit.</p>
    <div class="daydream"><div class="daydreamText">
        <p>i daydreamed<br>that i went to this evil and terrible meditation class. i was with the teacher and my eyes were closed, but the teacher sneakily secretly held something up to my nose that drugged me! so me and all the other meditators were being drugged and tricked into thinking it was "working" when really... we were drugged and now, addicted! talk about the exploitation of spirituality...<br>⋆｡°•☁︎<br>i also daydreamed that a raven came to my window and tapped on the glass, asking to come in. i was scared at first, i googled <i>what do ravens eat?</i> and opened up my window. the raven flew in and around my room, left a mess of feathers. it was chaotic. but then he perched on my hand and we became best friends. i wish i had a friend bird. that would be so nice... a dream of mine is to develop a lovely bond with a bird or another animal.<br>⋆｡°•☁︎<br>i also saw this shape that flipped and did a weird motion but it was super fast i couldn't even decipher what it was. it felt like the weird square shaped thing wooshed past me. i think that might just be me remembering the erratic silent hill esque movements i saw while watching <i>saw</i> (2004) yesterday.</p>
    </div></div>
    <p>and then my timer went off, and it was over! i'm sure it's probably just me being lost in the sauce of all this, but i don't think it matters because i felt way more energized than normal while i was making my breakfast. i hope this feeling lingers. i feel good. i think tonight, before bed (but before i get too sleepy) i hope to meditate some more and try to go for 20 minutes. but we'll see.</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible"><time>2025-01-16</time>: birthdays and strange dreams</button>
<div class="content">
    <p>i am two days late, but i completely forgot about the two year anniversary of this website. happy second birthday to <span style="color: #8c8cf5;">sabrin.party</span>! didn't think i'd make it this long, but now i'm here forever. may the party never end.</p>
    <p>i've noticed that for the past three winters, my music taste always tends to get very russian around this time. it's unintentional, i swear! but i just end up stumbling upon some nice russian music around this time of year. two winters ago it was a lot of russian indie, last year i was listening to some russian rock bands. and this year i've been listening to lots of russian EDM. don't ask me which bands i can't remember the ones from previous years because they were on spotify which i don't have anymore. i just download my music now. no more streaming for me. but this year i've been listening to a lot of <a class="bloglink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Sau7u32b0" target="_blank">ANGUISH</a> and <a class="bloglink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGS7UVRLyx0" target="_blank">Lieless</a>. all from this playlist i found on <a class="bloglink" href="https://goatcvlt.neocities.org/" target="_blank">goatcvlt</a>'s homepage. thanks for the new music, friend! just in time for my Russian Winter.</p>
    <p><img src="/assets/04-blog/2025-dream.webp" style="float: left; padding-right: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;">i had a strange dream this morning. it was short, and very boring. like most of my dreams that are never worth mentioning, but i mention them anyways. i was sitting in a room with laura palmer and donna hayward having a smoke. which is funny because i don't smoke, and can't seemingly imagine myself smoking cigarettes either so the cigarette they handed me turned into a joint in my hands. funny. they got up and left, and i woke up. a nothing dream. didn't think about that dream again until i heard news of david lynch's death. i don't normally get emotional about celebrity deaths. it's sad, but i never linger. this one hit me hard, for reasons i still don't know or understand. i remembered the dream i had this morning and the next thing i knew i was sobbing at my campus cafeteria while eating my lunch. it was uncontrollable. i still don't know why i cried. and then i stopped. and went to work! i will miss seeing what david lynch is up to. i like to hear about what he's watching, his COVID quarantine-era weather reports were so fun to watch as well... i don't know how to end this blog journal entry thing. bye!</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible"><time>2025-01-12</time>: no phone for a week</button>
<div class="content">
    <p>my phone broke while updating last week and i was procrastinating on fixing it for so long because i wanted to relish in the freedoms and peace of being unplugged (when i am outside...)</p>
    <p>i obviously was still very much plugged in, i still had my laptop and my iPad to keep me online, but even the little change of having no phone when i left the house was so nice. i made plans with friends the old fashion way (text them before i left the house, <i>hey! let's meet here at this time</i> and then i'd go there and simply Wait. the art of Waiting was lost but i found it again. it made reuniting feel so special. i spent more time people watching when i was on the train because i am not reading anything at the moment. and i listened to a lot of music i had on my mp3 player that i haven't listened to in a while. that's not super directly related to not having a phone, but it counts. i also forgot to bring my camera with me one day where i saw two turkeys sleeping up in a tree (which i've never seen before in my life) so when i got home i drew them from memory. see below.</p>
    <img src="/assets/04-blog/2025-nophone.webp" width="100%">
    <p>i eventually had to get it fixed, because both of my jobs require me to log into my accounts using 2FA (which i absolutely despise, by the way) and my phone couldn't ring. since i had no other way of getting my phone to ring, i relented and fixed my phone. so now i'm stuck with it again. unfortunately, for me at least, having a phone isn't something i can just choose not to use. the addiction is too strong. the grip it has on my neck is too tight. i'm trying to not redownload my brain kill apps, but we'll see how long that lasts.</p>
    <p>welp, it was a good week! i hope my phone breaks again soon!</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible"><time>2025-01-05</time>: tomodachi new year</button>
<div class="content">
    <p>i have spent the last few days totally obsessed with playing tomodachi life. god bless citra 3ds emulator because this little game is bringing me so much joy. i have been adding a mix of all my favorite characters onto <span style="font-style: italic; background-color: lemonchiffon;">weenie hut island</span> because i find it fun to watch characters from different universes interact with each other. like for example <a href="/shrines/mykaisen.html" target="_blank" class="bloglink">sukuna</a> and louis de pointe du lac are getting along really well. tojikuna backing up louis during his rap battle against daniel molloy was hilarious.</p>
    <video width="100%" controls><source src="/assets/04-blog/2025-tomodachi_rapbattle.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
    <p>everyone has been strangely in character, too. the first thing armand did with me was call me to play quiz games with him, and he was the one to establish the island ranking board to display everyone's stats every day and rank them accordingly. makes me think he would do this for the theatre de vampires back in paris... a funny thought. i've also been having lestat throw concerts where he preforms long face in different genres until i get sick of it. who needs a season 3 of interview with the vampire anyways.</p>
    <video width="100%" controls><source src="/assets/04-blog/2025-tomodachi_longface.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
    <p>playing with the jujutsu kaisen characters is making me miss my mundane au... i really need to fix my shrine for it, it looks so janky and i've been too lazy to fix it. perhaps i will, soon... i want sukuna and claudia to be mortal enemies, for my own amusement. i'm off to play some more, but here's a cute photo of lestat and another cute photo of me in the bath.</p>

<div class="content">
    <p>i've been exhausted as of late but i'm here to say hello, happy new year's eve. and i made another yearly media wrapped! this year was harder to compile, because i could not choose which of the 514+ movies and tv shows i wanted to include. i also did not listen to much new music this year since i deleted my spotify account... but i read quite a bit this year, even if i didn't meet my goodreads goal of 40 books lmao. i tried! 2024 was unbalanced in terms of my media consumption.</p>

    <p>i did watch a lot of yaoi this year, which led me to create the letterboxd tag: <span style="color: hotpink; font-weight: bold;">2024: the year of the fujoshi</span>. i predict next year's letterboxd tag will be <span style="color: hotpink; font-weight: bold;">2025: the year of the himejoshi</span>. may 2025 bring you peace, love, and more yuri. amen.</p>
    <p>p.s. i am just now realizing also that i didn't make space to showcase the manga i've been reading? perhaps my ode to shuzo oshimi will have to manifest in a different form... the internet must know how much i love this mangaka's work...</p>
    <p>p.p.s. this year's media wrapped design was inspired by those weird spiritual cult propaganda websites. i just really like their ominous energies and jarring graphic design tendencies. i hope that showed here. this design was originally a slideshow i made for my friend full of weird movie recs that i just edited for this. laziness rules. </p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible"><time>2024-09-17</time>: rant i wrote while i was zoned out in class</button>
<div class="content">
    <p>for context i started taking this film class for funsies and i'm really trying my best to have a good time here but i do start seething when i listen to people talk about positive representation for women and queer people specifically in media, and talk about over-sexualizing sex scenes and things of these sorts because what seems to be the underlying idea of these Thoughts i'm hearing is that people want happy media positive media un-challenging media and stories that portray women and gays as perfect morally correct beings. which is a bit of a hyperbole but it's what i get when you condemn queer villains and root for morally correct ones. which is like not a complete and thorough recap on my thoughts on the matter but whatever this blog is not real. at one point in the discussion/lecture i got so pissed off i just started rant writing in my journal and this is what i got. i could totally be completely wrong and that's okay because i don't know anything i'm just Feeling.</p>
    <p>what's the point of dealing with or discussing positive or negative queer characters within a hetero-sexist social context. queer characters, queer art is supposed to be transgressive. how is wanting for 'moral' queers supposed to challenge our norms? transgressive queer art is supposed to challenge us, show us the ugly parts of our society- of us. i don't want positive queer characters for the sake of having a positive queer character (or story). i don't care. i want interesting queer stories and characters. thinking back to the <a href="/assets/WhatsAGoodGayFilm.pdf">'what's a good gay film?'</a> chapter, why is the bar so low? i don't want to see gays living a white picket fence life. i don't want gay suburbia. i want the messiness, the conflicts, the unconventional endings where maybe they don't end up together in the end. whatever. being so stuck on this push for more positive representations and happy endings feels like we want writers to treat their audiences like they're stupid. or children who rely on media as a moral compass. art isn't supposed to be our moral compass. not art that's targeted towards adults. it's just so silly. i can't believe these convos i'm hearing in class are reminding me of stan twitter of all places. how on earth is 'ambiguous' and subtle homoeroticism supposed to be denying queer identities? erasing queer desire? what does desire look like? is there only one way to 'do desire'? what does it mean if we're defining what is and isn't an acceptable way to depict <i>wanting</i>. this conversation doesn't care to acknowledge the realness of lesbian desire in the form yearning. to yearn is lesbian. i feel like it assumes all valid and appropriate desire must be overt, or aggressive for people to see it as legitimate. which is just not true! vivian bell is not coded as a straight woman for being 'passive' in her desire. i disagree that she's being passive at all. ugh!</p>
    <p>i feel silly re-typing this now but i was seething when i wrote this lmao. i also don't want to make it seem like i hate cutesy fun lighthearted happy queer stories. they're fun. i loved saving face. i just don't like it when people talk like that's the only thing we should be creating. i don't like it when people try to moralize fiction in that specific way. i just feel like these conversations take things to the extreme. i don't like extremes. everything depends. i also feel like. these convos about respectability and stuff are such surface level feminism and queer theory. i just kinda wanna be like ok i know about the large scale patterns and problems. i know. can we now talk about the specifics. can we zoom in. anything else please. that's my incomplete thoughts. as of now.</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible" id="goodbyeriverdale"><time>2024-08-12</time>: goodbye, riverdale...</button>
<div class="content">
    <p>today marks the last time me and <a href="https://trelshouse.party/" target="_blank" class="bloglink">trels</a> will ever watch riverdale together for the first time while eating a sweet treat we made... but don't worry they're not dead or anything we just gotta find another camp drama to watch together. but still. we (finally) watched the last episode of riverdale today, which we were procrastinating on finishing for so long because who ever wants to say goodbye (not me, as you can probably tell)</p>
    <p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.postimg.cc/vTL4hz3N/2024-cake.webp" style="float: left; padding-right: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 140px; height: auto;">instead of our usual waffles this time we made red velvet cake ( in honor of the lovely cheryl blossom, <a class="bloglink" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jev.ffx/video/7255339217537043738?lang=en" target="_blank">who owns red, who IS red</a> ) with yummy cream cheese frosting. imagine the logo i just photoshopped on there was written in red icing. that was the idea. it was very yummy and my only regret is forgetting to take some home with me. i don't think i would have had a good way to do it either because i didn't bring a bag with me and was taking the train home. but alas. good memories.</p>
    <p>i just did not expect the series finale of riverdale to be so heavy on the death and growing apart themes, it caught me off guard and made me so emotional despite it being such a ridiculously written episode. we got to say goodbye to all the characters and confront death itself and sit with the tragic fact that betty cooper outlived all her friends and heard about how each and every one of them died in all sorts of different ways. it was really sad. but i loved it. because i love riverdale.. ugh! i think the most unhappy i was with a character ending was archie... his ass would never willingly and happily leave riverdale to settle down elsewhere. he loved riverdale too much to leave it forever so that made no sense! to me at least. also kevin and jughead being so successful is unrealistic and out of character. lol. maybe i'm just being mean. but at the same time i think it's so perfectly riverdalian of them to give everyone (except for fangs, my beloved, for some reason...) a neatly wrapped up happy ending. the cw is absolute trash. whatever. i love it. i'm also 90% certain that one of the bridges they showed in this was the same heaven bridge dean winchester drove down when he was doing his heaven drive during his show's finale. but i'm not sure. it would be funny if they used the same set.</p>
    <p>anyways i'm glad this show exists and i'm glad i got to celebrate it's end with emily and cake. couldn't have asked for a better way to experience this whacky tv show.</p>

    <p>there were more performances, with an amazing number by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/neoncalypso/" class="bloglink" target="_blank">neon calypso</a> herself which i sadly did not get on camera. forgive me, i was too enthralled. but trust me when i say it was so incredible! (take a shot every time i say incredible, i literally am still so giddy and giggly and excited from this i can't even write my brain is too frazzled that was just so fun!! and cool! and ahhh!) and the finale with all four of them at the end made me so emotional because they pointed out the family members of the performers and i cried!!!! someone (i forget who exactly) had their grandma in the audience!! their grandma!!!! i literally cried i had to rly stop myself before i ruined my makeup lol.</p>
    <p>i also managed to stay to do a fun little photoshoot with my friends before i had to hop in my too expensive uber to get home in time... i am literally like cinderella except my curfew is 9pm instead of midnight... lmao</p>

<div class="content">
     <p>i love going on my little solo adventures. especially when it's nice outside, 80-90 degree weather is my favorite. just me and my headphones against the world... walkin' around and discovering new shops. i used to do this <i>a lot</i> when i was in high school, but i haven't in years.. until today. which made me remember the reason i stopped... i forget money is a real thing! (silly answer but true)</p>

<div class="content">
    <p>happy late birthday to me again! i always want to blog on my birthday but i keep forgetting. i like being able to beg for attention it's the only day i'm allowed to do so without looking like a total freak. i didn't do anything special though, i never know what to do on my birthday. i don't know how to plan stuff and i feel insane asking people to do something for me. <img loading="lazy" src="https://i.postimg.cc/9Fn2x2cV/2024-turtlesting.webp" style="float: right; padding-left: 10px; width: 120px; height: 160px;" alt="a turtle and a stingray">even though i know it's unreasonable because i love being invited to my friends' birthday things. i dunno! weird. i was glad that my mom and sister got me a cheesecake to have after dinner. all that complaining and whining about their lack of me-celebration last year paid off! guilt tripping works! lmao. oh i haven't blogged in a while, i went to the aquarium recently too. here's a pic. i picked up a shark plush. i don't know what to name him. might just be lazy and name him after toji. rawr.</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible"><time>2024-03-03</time>: bad movies and dvds</button><div class="content">
    <p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.postimg.cc/SKWpNzCN/2024-dvds.webp" style="float: right; padding-left: 10px; width: 250px; height: 188px;" alt="my dvd collection so far">if you haven't already been seeing the absurd amount of media log updates on my page, i have been on a bad movie binge lately. i think <i>Things</i> (1989) was what started this whole thing, and i'm honestly not even sure what led me to that movie? since then i've been watching a ton of low to no budget movies that make no sense with questionable if any plots, lots of boobs, and bad acting. and i genuinely love them so much. not in a 'its so bad its good' way or in a 'i'm laughing at this way' because i don't think either of those are true for me. i just have so much fun watching movies where people are clearly having fun with it. when people let themselves enjoy things and take themselves less seriously. or even if they do take themselves seriously, they are serious in their unseriousness. does that make sense? it makes sense in my head. i don't know why but it beings me lots of joy. so my letterboxd has been on fire lately, and it's doing the opposite of my 'very limited social media use' thing because i am checking that app every hour. i love it when people like my reviews... i'm falling back into the social media devil trap again. it's also been feeding into my complex about needing to be different because i cannot express enough how fun and silly i feel when i see that i am one of seven people who have logged a movie on letterboxd. not even in a superiority way i don't think i just think it's so funny that i even found this weird movie in the first place.</p>
    <p>bad movies are fun! bad movies are art! bad movies are beautiful and good and interesting! i don't care that the acting is bad, it's so fun to watch! i love watching bad acting especially because i know i would act the same exact way if i was in a movie. and i guess that's what makes it real? i don't know what i'm saying anymore. there's so much joy in making art and watching art made my people who love making art. whatever.</p>
    <p>a simultaneous development has been my new dvd collection. i have some music albums on CDs and i've always really liked having Tangible Things and Stuff that i really Love. and i've realized that since everything is streaming and online, and that <i>my biggest love in life is tv shows and media</i>, i don't own any physical tv or movies! what! crazy! so i am slowly starting to collect dvds because they are awesome? i totally forgot that all of them come with bonus features and behind the scenes content which you never get on streaming services anymore. and it's just so insane to me how we stopped doing that. i love these bonus features so much. i watched the BTS feature for love exposure and it gave so much more context to the making of the movie that i loved so much. you can see how the actors weren't really as connected to their characters at first but once it clicked you can tell in their performances the moment they fell in love with their characters. things like this are just so fun to know and to have. so i went to goodwill today and found almost all of the twilight movies and mean girls on dvd and got them. a great day. i'm just now realizing i don't have the first one which is a bummer. but i'm excited to see the bonus features for the rest.</p>
    <p>besides that.. my usual boring life updates.. school is stressful but i don't think there's a minimum grade requirement for calc this time so i just need to pass to move on in my cs major which is a relief. my schedule is quite miserable though, i'm working or in school every day from 11am-7pm so i don't get home until 8pm every day... this should be illegal... i'm just so tired.. and i can't wait for the summer. even though i'll be working all summer as well... i wish i had a real break. but i can't! because i need money to live and stuff.. it's so sad.. i wasn't born to work.. i was born to wake up at 2pm and be happy.. but alas. and that concludes my complaints of the day!</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible"><time>2024-02-15</time>: yuri zine has changed my life</button><div class="content">
    <p>so. internet user <a href="https://longposter.neocities.org/#" target="_blank" class="bloglink">tshirt</a> who i admire greatly posts a lot about YAOI ZINE. a collaborative anthology zine about yaoi. the first one i read was vol 2 or as i call it, the jstor yaoi. i had missed the window the order my physical copy so i was reading the pdf but i never actually finished it. i just hate reading on online screens so it usually takes me longer. but jstor yaoi was the beginning of my Intense Love for this zine. because the one thing that probably makes me feel the most alive in this world is talking about what is considered to be unserious things (media in general, but specifically Cartoons and yaoi) in very serious ways. there is meaning to that. and the essays ive read made me feel so seen and also so.. real. in case you haven't noticed somehow i fucking love talking about the media i consume but i sometimes (a lot of the time) struggle to articulate some of the more complicated concepts i want to talk about. and the brilliant minds behind this zine cracked open my skull and went oh! so you meant this! and give me the words i needed for everything to make sense. anyways i'm starting to ramble and i haven't even mentioned the point of this post. i hear yaoi zine volume 3 is coming out and this time its YURI. so i'm like hell yeah and i got my physical copy. i love reading paper in my hands. was so excited for it. i got it in the mail yesterday and i quite literally haven't put it down since. and i'm not even done yet (i forced myself to stop with like 20 pages left because i want this to last longer...). just so you know how much i love this thing.</p>
    <p>so its a little past midnight and i'm rereading one of the earlier sections of the yuri zine and i come back to this quote, <strong>"sometimes when looking at my self is as painful as staring directly into the sun, my solution has typically been to study the reflection in the moon"</strong> and it all just sort of hit me. holy hell. <u>inside mari</u>. to study yourself through another pair of eyes, in her case.<img loading="lazy" src="https://i.postimg.cc/sDfk0z4x/2024-ramblingsofa-Mad-Man.jpg" style="width: 200px; float: left; padding-right: 5px; padding-top: 5px; height: auto;" alt="an incoherent scribble-filled page full of notes i took while rewatching perfect blue"> this language unlocked so many different ways of understanding inside mari that i just started scribbling on my ipad until next thing i knew an hour had passed and i ran out of white space and <i>how did i even get here?</i> anyways. here is the batshit insane looking page where i dumped all the thoughts i'm going to attempt to organize in paragraph form? open it in a new tab if you really want to actually read that monster of a thing.</p>
    <strong>the horror of Looking at your own self.</strong>
    <p>a lot of yuri zine talked about reading and interacting with yuri as a form of self identification. and how those bring up both good feelings (gender validating) and bad feelings (confronting yourself and your regret and your shame for whatever reasons you may have). both as a consumer of this media but also found within the characters themselves in the stories we read. considering how the big reveal of the entire story is about how. in an attempt to identify herself, mari was forced to truly <i>look</i> at herself. something she literally couldn't handle. throughout the zine, the authors all in one way or another touch upon the idea of how uncomfortable it is to confront yourself. to look at yourself. its shown through jennifer and needy's relationship in jennifer's body, which i hadn't thought about but one of the essays in this zine explains it so well. it's shown through when readers see too much of themselves in certain characters. this feeling of discomfort exists both in and out of the texts we talk about. and how this sort of leads into the understanding that yuri is <i>"the relationship to absence, to projection."</i> the yuri that of inside mari is how she <i>absents herself</i> as a way to <i>allow herself</i> to love Yori (to love girls in general). (i want to emphasize how in allowing herself, it implying the norm for her was denying herself, stopping herself, punishing herself for feeling the way she did) because the whole time, the mari we see is just mari the whole time. not komori body swapped into mari's body. <i>the mind warping mental gymnastics she goes through to live this sort of delusion allows her to be a boy who's just trapped in a girl's body. it allows her own self to love girls and accept this because. it's not mari thinking these things, it's komori who is a boy so. it's allowed.</i> this also speaks to <a class="bloglink" href="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*UnCGDPmoKa926HyIuySLBA.png" target="_blank">Shuzo Oshimi's thoughts on being a girl</a>. the ways mari goes about identifying her self while at the same time struggling with the mere act of Looking at her self is so yuri. i'm going to come back to this after i talk about Identity for a little bit hold on.</p>
    <strong>what is it that mari yearns for? what is it about gender?</strong>
    <p>mari's fragmented identity splits into three parts: fumiko, mari, and komori. her attachment to komori, the male identity she takes on stems from her hetero-patriarchal understanding of the world. she envies him for being able to experience sexuality and love girls in ways she feels she can't. but she ultimately abandons this identity too and exists as something separate from all three. or something that combines them all? the story ends with her alive and finally happy with herself. her attachment to komori's identity is less about his masculinity or maleness so to speak, but what she really desires is to love other girls in the specific (romantic, sexual) way he is allowed to in this society. her yearning is lesbian. i read her experience playing with gender not as her struggling with her own gender identity, but instead i felt that her beef was with the social performance of it all. i think she's a girl who doesn't feel connected to the daily practices and rituals that signal femininity. explaining why she sort of.. forgets how to do makeup and dress herself when she exists as the clueless komori inside mari's body.<i> she uses him</i> to liberate herself from these expectations. maybe i'm just full of shit. maybe her gender is just lesbian after all. another essay in the yuri zine talks about how yearning is gay. yearning is queer and yearning is lesbian. that yearning isn't limited to wanting to be with someone, but wanting to be someone. <i>to live life the way they do.</i> which hey. is literally what mari ends up doing in this story. what she yearns for is a reality that cannot exist (or rather, one that she cannot confront/reconcile with yet) she cannot look at herself, so she absents herself in order to allow herself to pursue her own desire. she felt like she couldn't pursue her desire in her current self, in her current standing as a girl in society.</p>
    <strong>what does it mean to feel like a person? to feel human?</strong>
    <p>i need to watch that interview everyone talks about "yuri made me human" because i already feel that truth in my core but i don't even know what the hell they're talking about in that interview. from the zine,<i> "is the fantasy of yuri about finding a way to become a person. when you don't feel like one?"</i> yes. but. what does it mean to feel like a person? in mari's case, which person? her First person? the one that died with her grandmother and replaced with a new name and identity by a mother she cannot understand or bond with? her Second person? mari? the person she grows to hate? <i>the one that is forced to perform these ritualistic practices that signal femininity but is never allowed to desire it for herself? </i>her Third person? komori? the depressed pathetic sexually frustrated hikikomori who is too stupid to see how good he has it* that he doesn't have to fend off boys who only objectify her? that he can have a girlfriend and kiss her and hold her hand in public without punishment? the komori that ultimately broke under the heavy weight of the truth that is not her. she is not him. she is no one for a while. yuri is everything and yuri is nothing. in fact, when mari is in that coma or whatever, yori desperately wants her back again, wants her awake, and she begs <i>"don't disappear"</i> until she wakes up into someone again. someone for yori. but most importantly, someone for herself (the first time i read this, i felt sort of disappointed? that yori and mari didn't get to live together forever but those feelings didn't last long... i don't actually want that for them. in fact i actually really love that they were able to reconcile their feelings for each other and also end on a note where yori goes to school and mari seems to actually be happy and secure with her own self) anyways. she struggles to connect to her fractured identities until through her growth as a character she not only starts <i>feeling</i>like a person but <i>becoming</i> one, probably for the first time.</p>
    <p>inside mari is fascinating to look at and unpack from a yuri pov. i loved thinking about how <b>this too was yuri</b>, that she envies komori for his ability to pursue and love women. the way she <i>projected</i> onto him. the way she wanted something <i>nonexistent</i> and <i>intangible</i>. the way she yearned through imagining she existed as something other than herself. the way she shattered when faced with herself. the way she existed not as a participant, nor an observer. the way she loved yori so much she became everyone and no one.</p>
    <p><b>in conclusion</b> please read yuri zine and please also read yaoi zine 1 and 2 they are genuinely so good. bless the minds of everyone who worked on these.. the yaoi yuri theorists i look up to.... there's no real conclusion to this ramble i hate conclusions. i'm done. i know this isn't my usual journal entry post i just needed to write about my feelings on this. good night...</p>

    <ul><li>greener grass shrine that's structured like those crazy conspiracy pin boards. take images from the movie that i connect with red string, and then when you hover over each image you can read a blurb about what that scene means..</li>
    <li>i've gotta update the bird zone and podcast shrine soon...</li>

    <p>winter break is soon coming to an end, so i'm sure i'll be way more active on here once the semester starts and i'm back to my usual stressing. over break i've been mostly watching an absurd amount of god awful movies, which i've been logging in my media log thing. i cherish that part of my site. i want to figure out a way to have some sort of tagging or filtering system on there? i planned to work on that over break but never got around to it. i feel like i should be able to know how to do that.. i just took a java course so it would be nice if i could actually put those skills to use, i guess.</p>

<button type=button class=collapsible><time>2023-12-03</time>: fashioned by sargent exhibit thoughts</button><div class="content">
    <p>i went to the mfa last friday because i was required to take a selfie with some statue for my art history final. i also realized i could go to the Fashioned by Sargent exhibit, which i've actually been meaning to go to for so long, but haven't because school has been keeping me so busy. so i decided to kill two birds with one stone. i honestly expected this experience to go as my usual trips to the museum. but alas, the adhd demons have struck again. although i am reluctant to give credit to the french in any way, i was charmed by this john singer sargent lad... he took full creative control over every aspect of the portraits he painted. he decided the dresses, the background and location, the poses, <i>everything</i> was chosen and designed by him. i haven't stopped thinking about his portraits all day and i've decided to stop yapping at all my friends about this fuck ass french painter and write about it here instead...</p>
    <a class="bloglink" href=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/16255 target=_blank><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.postimg.cc/MpVLyJT9/2023-hammersley.webp" style="width:180px; height: 240px; float:left;padding-right:10px"></a>
    <p style=margin-top:-4px><strong><i>Mrs. Hugh Hammersley</i></strong>'s portrait (1892) was one of my favorite portraits i saw yesterday. i was first really drawn to the color of the dress she was wearing, and did a double take take because the way he rendered the velvety silk fabric of the dress was honestly.. i don't even know how to adequately put it into words i was starstruck. it was the first time i've seen such care put into painting fabric like this. what's really fun is that sargent sent mrs hammersley a scrap <img loading="lazy" src="https://i.postimg.cc/NMfPqyxn/2023-hammersley-card.webp" style="float:right; padding-left:10px; padding-top:5px; width:140px; height: 107px;">from the dress she wore along with a cute note that says "part of the gown in which my beloved sister, w. hugh hammersley, sat to john sargent" as a souvenir. i thought that was really sweet and reading that made me really fond of this portrait.</p>
    <a href=https://www.dailyartmagazine.com/lady-agnew-john-singer-sargent/ target=_blank><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.postimg.cc/ZR7sTT75/2023-agnew.webp" style="width:180px;float:right;padding-left:10px;height:240px;"></a>
    <p style=margin-top:-4px>the <strong><i>Lady Agnew of Lochnaw</i></strong> (1892) was another portrait i really fell in love with. the first thing i noticed was how comfortable and casual her pose was. and i found her gaze to be particularly striking... i think the first thought i had when i saw this was that tweet that went like "she looks like she's trying to attract women" which is a very silly thought to have when looking at fine art but it's true. she does. i don't know much about fine art or portraits from this era but i've never seen this energy depicted in portraits like this before. it really stood out to me. the wall text said that miss agnew had the flu when she was sitting for this portrait, and for some reason this small bit of context made me love this portrait even more. also, i wish i looked this good sick with the flu...</p>
    <a href=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/21453 target=_blank><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.postimg.cc/VvJGv3pB/2023-carmencitadress.webp" style="width:180px;float:left;padding-right:10px;height:240px;"></a>
    <p>overall, the coolest thing about this exhibit was how they brought in the same dresses that were in a lot of the portraits to show side by side. my favorite dress they had on display was the one worn for <strong><i>La Carmencita</i></strong>'s portrait (1890). the overlay of the mesh fabrics and the embroidered design reminded me a lot of moroccan kaftans. apparently, she was a very restless sitter, which is funny because her portrait is, as all of sargant's portraits, stationary. lots of classist folk were not too happy with sargent for painting her, but he seems like the kind of guy who did not give a fuck. there were a lot more dresses and portraits side by side that i really loved, but i did not take as many photos as i had wanted to. too busy experiencing the exhibit with Awe. i already want to go back...</p>
    <a href=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/644345 target=_blank><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.postimg.cc/T1BkDtX8/2023-pozzi.webp" style="width:180px;float:right;padding-left:10px;height:240px;"></a>
    <p>there were also a lot of male portraits shown at the exhibit, but only two really caught my eye. the first one, <strong><i>Dr. Pozzi at Home</i></strong> (1881) was really striking.. he just looks soooo cozy here with the velvet curtains in the back i am a big fan. apparently this guys was a gynecologist so props to him for knowing how pussy works. my favorite part of the wall text was that he was often described by the men around him as exceptionally beautiful. and that sargent was really charmed by dr. pozzi as well.. which was kind of obvious based off the energy coming from this portrait..</p>

    <p>the other guy portrait i really liked was his <strong><i> Portrait of Charles Deering </i></strong> (1917) who was one of sargent's lifelong besties. some crazy business man on vacation in florida... i was really charmed by his outfit. the off-white suit, the straw hat, his white shows while surrounded by palm trees is just such a lovely image. i appreciate the calm soothing energies radiating off this portrait. and i know this is the jjk brainrot speaking but this also made me think of nanami kento... this is what he should have been doing.... what he deserved.. missing him..</p>
    <p>the exhibit is still open until the 15th of january.. i really want to go again. maybe next month i'll even buy the art book if i am still as obsessed with these portraits as i am right now. now i have to go study for my compsci exam. finals season has been really beating my ass this semester. i considered #blogging about it but i don't wanna bring my emo-ness onto here.. its such a lovely place, my website... keep it nice and good vibes and stuff. hope you enjoyed my ramblings on my favorite sargent paintings i will probably do this again..</p>

<button type=button class=collapsible><time>2023-11-08</time>: i'm cursed by a fictional character</button><div class="content">
    <img loading="lazy" src="https://i.postimg.cc/XYSHN18d/2023-knives.webp" style="float: left; padding-right: 10px; padding-top: 25px; width: 160px; height: 213px;">
    <p>alright this is going to sound very silly but i just need to write this down. i think i am being cursed by millions knives the fictional character from trigun. that would be a great reddit post title if i had a reddit account tbh. to start off i need to give u a rundown of my trigun merch and other fan stuff purchases so you can Understand the full story.</p>
    <p>last summer i bought a knives plushie and Only a knives plushie because i was too broke to buy all three (vash and wolfwood) at the same time. but apparently not too broke to also buy a knives, wolfwood, and vash keychain, and also a knives bottle cap pin (all these except the plushie are from <a href=https://cranity.bigcartel.com/ target=_blank class="bloglink">cranityshop</a> btw check them out they're one of my favorite artists Very cool). anyways the point is that's a lot of stuff but i got one of Each character because i wanted all of them. to be together. and live together as a fucked up family on my keychain thingy, right? so here's where it gets funny.</p>
    <p>i get the plushie in september. amazing. couple weeks later i get 1 of 2 packages with the keychains, i got my knives keychain! great amazing so exciting. i put him on my jeans. so now i have a count of 2: knives merch. couple weeks later i get part 2 of 2 of my package so naturally im expecting the vash wolfwood and knives pin. <strong>however!</strong> there was a silly mixup with the packages and i open the envelope to see.. a knives keychain. identical to the one i have! so i'm like omg that is so funny. i have.. 2 knives know. 3 total technically. and no vashwood no pin. so i email the lovely shop owner and they're like oopsies! sorry for the mix up i'll send ur stuff next week and they did! great amazing. the package comes and IT'S JUST THE KNIVES PIN. SO NOW I HAVE SO MUCH KNIVES MERCH AND NO OTHER TRIGUN CHARACTER MERCH. and i just want to be clear i'm not complaining at all i literally love this artist and am so grateful they have their stuff up for sale i just think this string of mixups and miscommunications is absolutely hilarious</p>
    <p>so my theory is... knives may have manifested himself into reality and is using his cursed evil territorial vibes to sabotage my trigun purchase orders and manipulate them somehow so that the only thing that enters my house is knives. it's the only valid explanation for this silly series of events. what else could it possibly be? why is it that the knives always make it to my home safe and sound but vash and wolfwood are not allowed. it is clear to me that knives has marked my home as his territory and that obviously i'm not allowed to love anyone else except for him.so that's where i'm at now. another piece of supporting evidence for this i forgot to add is that when i got my first knives keychain i wore him once and then the next day i forgot to bring him out with me and that was the Worst day i had in months. it wasn't that deep but just a series of miserable unimportant events: coffee order somehow didn't go through and i had to wait30 minutes to make me another one. was late to class. i had a quiz i forgot about and didn't prepare for. my stomach growled so loud in class the girl next to me Turned Around and Looked AtMe like i did something wrong. the train broke down on my way home. i just felt like knives was punishing me for leaving me home. so now he's on my keychain permanently and i never take him off. he has grown attached to me now and there's nothing i can do about it. i just wish he'd let me let other trigun guys into my home to keep him company... or something..</p>
    <p>anyways this is ridiculous i just wanted to share... i hope you can find some enjoyment from this...</p>

    <p>monumental moment for the noodle dick group chat (est. maybe 2012? or 2013 i can't remember exactly)!! my cool friend amelia came downtown to visit and have lunch!!! i am overusing these exclamation points because i cannot emphasize enough how happy i am that i got to meet them for the first time in person!! it's always great when the online friend becomes an IRL.<img loading="lazy" src="https://i.postimg.cc/qBtHzY85/2023-copslide.webp" style=float:left;padding-right:10px;width:150px;padding-top:10px;height:200px> it's like a level up. despite the pouring rain we took our soaked selves to wagamamas because i love their ramen (and so does jinsoul, as you can see...) and we hung out around the city until it was time to bid our farewells and part ways. i also got to see the cop slide for the first time!! i had first heard about the latest tourist attraction in boston this past summer, but i forgot to visit it until now. it was so fun. a very wonderful day. i just wanted to document it here for the #memories. i hope they come back to visit again i honestly had such a good time. thank you amelia for the <a href=https://store.steampowered.com/app/2104990/Garage_Sale/ target=_blank class="bloglink">garage sale</a> pins i am this upcoming video game's #1 fan...</p>

<button type=button class=collapsible><time>2023-09-03</time>: head full so many thoughts...</button><div class="content">
    <p>it's funny, i've noticed a strong correlation between my creativity levels and my stress levels. as soon as i start stressing out about something (ahem, school) i start thinking genius thoughts and creating so much Art (in the most untraditional sense). i'm not <img loading="lazy" src="https://i.postimg.cc/xTJjV8xq/2023-injuries.webp" style="width: 150px; height: 215px; float: left; padding-right:10px;padding-top:10px">really looking forward to school, despite Loving school a lot. i'm just really nervous to start again. so for the past few days i've been thinking a lot about how the trans experience is represented in movies and tv shows.</p>
    <p>i made my first ever zine (on canva... i didn't have the materials i wanted to make it by hand which was what i had originally wanted to do)! it's basically a character study on wolfwood and i used him to think about the connection between the body horror genre and transness. you can read it <a style=color:#7f75f6 target=_blank href=https://t.co/e7Z8REjvsd>here</a>, but i think i want to find a home for it on my website too. later. the page i'm most proud of is the one on injuries. i feel like i articulated those thoughts the best.</p>
    <p>since then i've been on a roll of consuming media with very similar themes. i watched The Fly (1986) which was a very fun way of exploring gender through body horror. and now i'm re-watching BNA with my friend lola. i had first watched this anime in 2020, so i remember literally nothing. it's perfect because it feels like i'm watching it for the first time all over again. during this watch i was really struck by the transgender themes, especially in episode 4 that centers nina and our main girl michiru. the entire episode basically tells the story of two closeted trans kids sneaking out to a party where they seek acceptance, get to explore their gender the way they want to for the first time, are met with hostility, and come back home with no regrets.</p>
    <p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.postimg.cc/ncyFFxg2/2023-nina1.webp" style=float:right;padding-left:10px;width:190px;height:107px>nina is introduced as this dolphin girl who's totally obsessed with being a human and "passing" as one. she's an internet celebrity and tells everyone online that she's a human. online, she can actually control the way people perceive her and gets to exist in the identity she chooses! the one she feels she belongs to! michiru also has a lot of Body Struggles existing as a beastman when all she wants is to go back to being a human too. she's unhappy with her body and doesn't feel like it belongs to her. so once she realizes she can look human again on command, she and nina sneak out (without permission) to go to a party where nina is told she will be accepted. there, nina fully embraces what it's like to exist as a human. even tho michiru is still so hesitant and terrified and anxious and not ready to Come Out. and this party is so fascinating because everyone there puts up <img loading="lazy" src="https://i.postimg.cc/kgWnDZdm/2023-nina2.webp" style=width:200px;float:left;padding-right:10px;padding-top:10px;height:112px> this facade of #allyship and nina gets so caught up in the excitement she accidentally turns back into a dolphin in front of everyone. the partygoers then start to parade her around like she's a shiny new toy creature and from that point onwards they only see her as a dolphin. it's like even when cis people get your pronouns and name right, you can tell when they don't really see you as your true identity. they still subscribe to the gender structures you're trying so hard to break out of. the partygoers just put nina back in this <s>box</s> (fish tank) she never wanted to be in, and it really sucks. nina gets hurt, michiru takes her home, and talks about regretting going to the party. to this, nina melts my heart and tells her that even though their night out didn't go as planned, and even though she was hurt and it was hard, she still loved her time there. she still loved being a human because that's who she really is! it was such a beautiful moment and so explicitly queer.</p>
    <p>do you see how all of these thoughts come to me at 4 in the morning when i'm supposed to be sleeping, fixing my sleep schedule, and preparing for classes. do you see how these thoughts plague my mind during the most inconvenient of times. do you see how i struggle with these huge massive juicy brilliant brain babies that come to me during the wee hours of the night when i have other babies to tend to.</p>

<button type=button class=collapsible><time>2023-08-22</time>: back home</button><div class="content">
    <p>i've officially settled from my summer trip to morocco! that was fun. i am glad to be back. i missed seeing my friends. and watching tv! and good iced coffee. emphasis on the last one.</p>
    <img loading="lazy" src="https://i.postimg.cc/mrwByHDp/2023-meatloaf.webp" style=width:180px;height:180px;float:left;padding-right:10px>
    <p>despite being ultra mega broke right now, i got very bored yesterday and went on a walk to the coffee shop and bookstore, and stopped by goodwill to check out their music collection. it hit me that i have a whole ass CD player, and thrift stores would surely have a neat collection of music for me to check out. so i went! i found meat loaf's welcome to the neighborhood. i've only listened to a few of their songs here and there and really liked them, so i picked it up to listen when i got home. i really like it! very meat loaf. and the album cover is wicked cool. i currently have it playing on repeat until i get sick of it completely.</p>
    <p>i'm not mentally prepared to go back to school, but i still have a couple weeks before we start. i am most looking forward to having a job again. i went a little crazy with the summer spending this year... lots to pay back. but everything will be fine if i don't stress about it too much. peace and love, or whatever that trigun guy says..</p>

<button type=button class=collapsible><time>2023-07-23</time>: trip to the mountains!</button><div class="content">
    <p>after three years of begging my mom to take me up to the mountains of morocco where she's from, my dream finally came true! <img loading="lazy" src="https://i.postimg.cc/tTvbLGFh/2023-mountains1.webp" style="float:left;padding-right:10px;width:180px;padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;height:240px">we spent two days there and it was by far the highlight of my summer. we arrived at around 9am and had breakfast, and i met a lot of my mom's cousins and their kids and they are all such wonderful people. they were really surprised i could speak arabic and that i was so happy to be there. i just love the countryside. it's rare i get to experience it. after breakfast we all went out and explored their land to see what they grew over there. most of it was olive trees but i was nibbling from all of the fruit trees i could reach. they had carob trees, i ate figs, blackberries, pomegranates, oranges, lemons, watermelons, squash, and others i am probably forgetting. after that we went back home and had lunch <img loading="lazy" src="https://i.postimg.cc/qBY0w0Jr/2023-bunnies.webp" style="float:right;padding:10px;width:180px;height:240px">and one of my cousins found some bunnies and showed them to us! they were so cute. i loved hearing about all the plants they grow there and the animals they take care of. i wish i had that kind of knowledge on the life that surrounds us. i'm tired of being a city slicker. we spent the night hanging out with my mom's family and talking to them about all sorts of things. i got a huge ego boost because of how impressed they were of me, which is pretty funny.<img loading="lazy" src="https://i.postimg.cc/nLcc5k6f/2023-mountains3.webp" style="width:180px;float:left;padding:10px;width:170px;height:226px"> the bar is so low when it comes to moroccans who grew up outside of morocco that they were really surprised that i was actually able to hold a conversation! the next day i woke up at 5am (the roosters and dogs barking were really loud, but it didn't really bother me much. it was like a Natural Alarm Clock) and we all went on a long hike all the way to the top of the mountain they live on. i had so much fun i've never been happier. we ate all sorts of berries on the way (mostly blackberries which i don't even like much, but they were so yummy!). i came across this skull. i forget what creature left it here. most likely either a horse or a cow, i remember asking but i forgot the answer. it shall remain a mystery. i think the hike took a total of 2 hours up and down. it was wonderful. my mom's aunt gave me a headscarf and a 'mendil' so i looked very rural. after the hike we finally had breakfast at around 11am i think. and i took a fat nap. i woke up just in time for lunch and we had cous-cous!<img loading="lazy" src="https://i.postimg.cc/85xp7VsT/2023-mountains4.webp" style="width:220px;float:right;padding:10px;height:165px;"> which also makes me really sleepy so i took another short nap. after that i went down to the well and filled up jugs of water for the family, and the water was so delicious. if you think water can't be yummy you're wrong. after that we had dinner and spent the rest of the night telling each other riddles (which i could not figure out for the life of me...) and chatting. it was really nice and i loved the time i spent there. i plan on visiting the mountains every time i come to morocco from now on. i love it so much! that's all for my summer updates... </p>
    <p>on an unrelated note, i really wanted to see Barbenheimer at the movies but i doubt they'll still be in theaters by the time i come back home. i could technically watch them while i'm here but i did not pack my barbie outfit... and who would i be if i didn't go see barbie in my pretty pink outfit. not myself, that's for sure. even if i don't see them in theaters, i have plans to watch them both at home with my dearest miraç (≧◡≦) ♡ so i'll be looking forward to that.</p>

I was way too shy to dance (felt very out of my element) but it was so much fun! the food was delicious I had 4 of those mini quesadillas and a virgin mojito. mojitos seem to be all the rage this summer in Morocco (they even have them in McDonalds?) they're not even that good...</p>
            <p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.postimg.cc/L6t98wSM/2023-asilah.webp" style="width:180px;float:right;padding-left:10px;height:240px">after the tangier trip we stopped by Asilah on the way back home to my grandmother's house. oh to live in one of those gorgeous neighborhoods. walking down the streets of Asilah will never get old, it's so beautiful. there's so much art around and i wanted to buy All Of It So Bad...... but I did not have any money... so sad. I'm grateful I got to enjoy it all in the first place. except, at this point in the trip i was so exhausted i could barely stand on my two feet anymore... I hope to visit again soon when I'm not so tired and achey, since it's not too far from where I'm staying.</p>
            <p>after the tangier/asilah trip, i entered my beach bum era! i told my cousins i wanted to have a beach bum summer and it's been going well so far. i wish i could embrace the beach bum life back home but there's just no good beaches near massachusetts. that don't cost a bajillion dollars to get to. moroccan beaches are superior anyways. i went to kahf lhmam two days in a row and it was great. i got a little burnt for the first time! it doesn't hurt but i'm red all over. i guess they weren't kidding when they said the UV would be at 11 those days... it was intense! i loved swimming at the beach i'm itching to go again. there's nothing better than that special kind of Beach Hunger and the Post-Beach Sleep..... after day 1 of Beach i slept for 13 hours... i was so tired. on day 2 i went into the mountains on that beach and scooped up some algae clay and put it all over my face and chest and arms as a clay mask. it made my skin so soft.. hope you enjoyed reading my Highlights i hope they were coherent. i'm re-watching trigun stampede as i write this so.. hehe</p>

            <p>after that we hung around the harbor and made up stories about how bostonian children get christened in the water where they did the boston tea party back in 1772. and i took that photo of my friend because their jacket matched the boat in the back and it was cute.</p>
            <p>as i am typing this i just realized we never made it to the juneteenth celebration we were supposed to go to... i actually just facepalmed so hard. going to text this to them later. wow. that's the only downside to this trip i can't believe we forgot. well... we'll gettem next time! other than that, i am actually so happy i got to see them today and i had so much fun and i miss them already. i love adia! i can't wait for the next time we hang out (in person) ☆⌒ヽ(*'､^*)chu</p>

            <p>on another note i've been wanting to do yet another complete redesign of my website... i want a lighter theme that feels more 2007 web design with like fake ads and stuff... but keep the omori references on every page. i have some ideas i hope to get around to this summer. i'm off to binge the rest of succession now..... farewell</p>

            <p>personally i think it should be a crime that spring break only lasts a week. it all went by so fast! this week my friends from out of state and i got to spend a few days together over spring break and i had so much fun! we went to the aquarium and i made lots of sea creature friends, it was really nice. we also saw two museums and went to this super cute crafts place where we made hair clips and phone cases, and i really want to go back soon to make a rug because that looked really fun. i also had some of the tastiest ramen and the tastiest nigerian food i've ever had in my life. man i love good food. here are some photos i took during our trip!</p>

            <p>besides these adventures i'm also super close to finishing my third full play-through of OMORI with my friend (we just entered blackspace, aaah!) and i am super excited to see how they will play out the ending. i love that game so much and it's so much fun sharing the OMORI experience with a friend too. i'm glad i got to make the most of my spring break, i totally wasn't expecting all this excitement! i am very much dreading the start of school again on monday... i have so much to work on. sunday will be crunch time... well. off i go!</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>jennette mccurdy?! at MY school?! it's more likely than you'd think. last Friday the one and only jennette mcCurdy came to my campus to talk about her book and i had no idea this event was happening until literally 2 hours before. i battled <img loading="lazy" src="https://i.postimg.cc/Y0tXfvvR/2023-jmbook.webp" style="float: left; padding: 10px; height: 200px; width: 132px;"> many demons and the will of gods in order to make it in time to see her and i'm so glad i did. i bought her book & audio cd as i was sitting there looking at her and watching her talk. it was surreal. jennette was sooo inspiring to me it was incredible to hear her talk ab her one woman show and her book and also her future plans! she's so funny and also.. maybe a little tooo relatable at times. i can't wait for my book to come to i can read it and maybe blog about it later. just wanted to document this highlight of not only my year, but my LIFE! i'll be thinking about this day forever... and if you're reading this. go buy I'm Glad My Mom Died by jennette mccurdy from your local bookstore i know you have one..</p>

        <button type=button class=collapsible><time>2023-01-22</time>: daily blog: puss in boots!!!!</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>hello! i'm having a lot of fun learning how to animate images. although it's really really hard. anywho. its the last day of ~freedom~ before my semester starts tomorrow, and i am really nervous about my upcoming calculus and computer science classes.</p>
            <p>i am not really a math person, and i added this computer science degree to my course load because i wanted a challenge (and i don't want to be poor!) ..・ヾ(。＞＜)シ but i know i can do well! i know once i start classes tomorrow i will feel better.</p>
            <p>this post is doubling as a movie review for <strong>puss in boots: the last wish</strong>. i saw this yesterday with my friend and we LOVED it. this was so surprisingly good i am comfortable calling it the most best Movie ever.</p>
            <p>i've never seen the previous movies so i didn't really know what to expect. the first / intro song <a class="bloglink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8EAdlxwsq8">"fearless hero"</a> is such a bop it's been stuck in head since i watched it. i loved everything about that movie it's hard to figure out where to start. i loved the villain of the movie, the Reaper wolf guy. and i love how he wasn't really a bad guy, just absolutely terrifying (nearly pissed myself whenever he showed up) (fun fact: my friend told me during the movie that in some cultures, people bury loved ones with coins atop their eyes and that sort of symbolizes death, hence the coins in wolfie's eyes. i just thought that was really cool). i've never seen a movie like this explore the fear of death, how to deal with these fears and still make sure to keep it light. making movies suitable for both children and adults is an incredible skill! (ᗒᗣᗕ)՞</p>
            <p>i am officially a puss in boots Fan after watching this movie. kitty and puss are so much fun. i really enjoyed their dynamics and their adorable ending together. i'm not much of a romantic but who wouldn't awe at "one life spent with you is all that i could wish for" like come on now. (≧◡≦) ♡</p>
            <p>i guess my one critique of the movie was that it would have been better if there were more songs. but that doesn't really carry much weight overall. i think with that intro song i was expecting more songs like a disney movie. and it would have been so good. but despite all that i'd give this movie a 10/10. the animation was incredible, i love how choppy it looked (choppy isn't the right word, but whatever they did gave it a comic-book esque feel and i really loved it)</p>
            <p>after seeing that masterpiece of a film, me and my friend went to a vegan thai food place nearby. i had fried dumplings, <img loading="lazy" src="https://i.postimg.cc/vTX0PG9s/2023-soup.webp" style="float: left; padding: 10px; height: 150px; width: 150px;"> wontons (yum), and some tom yum gai soup. every time i try something new here to see what i like. i did not enjoy the soup as much but i think that's just because i don't like water based soup in general. i luv creamy soups. next time i'm in town i think i will try one of their noodle soups. they come in huge bowls, so i will definitely be taking home leftovers. (^人^) that's all i have for today. hope you enjoyed my rambles.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>i think i'm starting to get a hang of this website building thing? thank you to the internet for being my teacher... it is so late, my head hurts a little and i'm still not tired. i am to blame. once i figure out this whole coding thing and learn how to make stuff fully on my own i will probably have more puter-related things to say. but for my first post? entry... i will practice my list making skills.</p>
            <p>that was a lie i won't be doing that yet. first i want to tell you about my day. i went to a <strong>bookstore!!!!!</strong> with my friend and even though i said i would only buy myself two books i could not control my impulses so i bought four. here is a list of the books i bought today:</p>
            <ul style=padding-left:25px>
                <li><u>folklorn</u> by Angela Hur</li>
                <li><u>thistlefoot</u> by GennaRose Nethercott</li>
                <li><u>cassandra at the wedding</u> by Dorothy Baker</li>
                <li><u>decline and fall</u> by Evelyn Waugh (which uh... i am nervous about ngl)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>so that's exciting! here's a picture i took when i got home from my trip. and also a picture of the egg sandwich i had too. it was so delicious. scrambled eggs. avocado. pesto. cheese. tomato. on english muffin. mmmmmm... getting hungry again just thinking about it.</p>
