                <p>iason has always had what he's supposed to want. he is feared, he is respected. he has all the wealth and power he could ask for. he has human furniture at his beck and call and human pets to sit there and look pretty like little decorated ornaments. he has the perfect mind, the perfect body, and is one of the pillars of their godless society, yet he and the rest of the blondies are still worshiped. being worshiped is isolating. and dehumanizing.</p>
               </div>
            <div class="collumn">
                <p>so when iason comes across riki, who does not worship him, who treats iason with the same disdain and devil-may-care attitude as anyone else, iason feels </p>
                <div class="head"><p>an emotion for the first time ever probably. he becomes obsessed with the feeling of being seen as something other than a mighty god, a divine creature of technology. the way his motivations switch gears after encountering riki for the first time was amusing to me, reading the novels was like watching a live play-by-play of iason’s brain short circuiting every time he has a Feeling. because having an Emotion is way too human for someone like him, a half-android sorta-human blonde boy like himself... this is the beginning of iason's humanization project through yaoi and desire. </p>
                </div>
                <p>men (iason) only want one thing (and it's fucking disgusting). riki and his obnoxious leo energy (astrology source: me) seem to light a fire in everyone within a twenty mile radius of him and also turn their worlds upside down. he's such a polarizing character. most people hate him, and those who don't, love him for how aggressive and disruptive he is, the grenade that blows up everyone's understanding of the world around them and makes a dazzling spectacle out of it. so despite the fact that iason has access to all the technology and advancements the world has to offer, none of it is real. raoul's biotechnological successes (read: eugenics projects) developed a capitalist fascist hellscape so profitable and so "efficient" but so far removed from the reality that grounds the human experience-- the body! that sensation of being alive. the pain and the pleasure. and he wants that to himself. his selfish desire to feel human morphs and mutates into his selfish desire to have riki all to himself, even if it costs him everything.</p>

                </figure><p>iason is told by his peers that what he wants cannot possibly be. that what he wants is below him. that his desires are undesirable. that his search for humanity has no value. which only makes iason reject the social rules of Tanagura more forcibly. he is so overwhelmed with his need to feel what riki feels, to experience the best and worst sensations at the same time, to feel something in his that mechanical body of his, because it's the one thing his so called perfect body isn't engineered to do. why is it that the main cultural economic engine of Eos is it's showcase of sexual exploitation, but those who reap the benefits of that labor physically cannot touch it themselves? i dunno. it's enough for iason to question the values of the Tanagura elites, and it's what pushes him to accept the consequences of rejecting it all. <i>if that</i> [points at riki in a puddle of his own tears and jizz after being edged for hours] <i>isn't what you consider the pinnacle of life itself then i don't want what you're selling me.</i></p>

                <p style="font-style: normal;">for a world that's literally built on exploiting desire itself for power and profit, it's funny how iason crumbled the moment he experienced that desire for himself. something something about the biopolitics of his own created society ended up incarcerating himself in the process thru the self-policing done by the other blondies. "no you can't want him like <i>that</i> you have to want him like <u>this</u>." etc etc.</p>
                <div class="head"><span class="headline hl1">on letting go...</span><p><span class="headline hl4">iason mink learns life lessons</span></p></div>
            <p style="font-style: normal;">"if you love someone, set them free. if they're yours, they'll come back to you." is bullshit (or is it?), according to one insane stalker iason (riki's words, not mine). after all, iason tried that already! he let riki go back to ceres after three years of captivity, but he never actually let go of riki. <i>be free!</i> he said. <i>i still have your name on the pet registry and you're still legally mine,</i> he didn't say. iason, the man that he is, made sure to keep the legal ties between him and riki in tact as a form of insurance. no matter what, riki is still his. but that's not really setting someone free. which is why, when riki came back a year later, he wasn't really his. not yet, at least.</p>

            </figure>
            <p style="font-style: normal;">in fact, it's not until the very end, until it's too late for him, that iason truly lets go of riki. it's only when he's confronted with how much guy means to riki that he relents, because unlike kirie, he doesn't want riki to really hate him. he'd rather die loved by riki than live and be hated by a man who hates himself. so when he saves guy, and saves riki, sacrificing himself, he lets go of riki for realsies.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="collumn">    
                <p style="font-style: normal;">only when iason truly let go of riki, did riki come running back. only when riki realized the weight of iason's desire (or if you're watching the super romantic 1992 OVA, love) for him, did riki finally give his heart to iason. witnessing iason abandon himself and everything he stood for is what made riki </p>
        
           <p>turn back, to give iason not only himself, but one last act of comfort. i won't let him die alone. because after all this time, riki learned what people mean to each other. he knows that people need to lean on each other, and so riki leans onto iason, and iason leans onto him. and so in the end, iason died with riki in his arms, holding onto what was given to him willingly (this time).</p>

        </figure>
        <p>there's just something to yaoilicious about iason mink, Tanagura's favorite genius boy, losing all rational thought when it comes to riki (because since when is yaoi ever rational) and riki, the clever charismatic cutthroat leader of the bison gang, confessing to katze that being with iason makes his head spin? that he can't help being with him? their yaoi is explosive, impulsive, chaotic, disorderly, and permanently world-altering. their yaoi developed from the process of their own undoing. the way they grapple with their desires clashed with their society in a way that led them to a path where the only choice was to self-destruct. self-cannibalize. yaoi that burns so hot there's nothing left but ash and some leftover liquid nitrogen (thanks guy!).</p>
        <p>and i think that’s what makes the yaoi of the late 90s feel so different from BL today. ai no kusabi is yaoi that burns hot and burns out. it’s not about a happy ending, it's not about living together in domestic bliss after all the horrors they've endured, nor is it about “pure love” as reiko yoshihara puts it.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="collumn">
                <p> ai no kusabi is more focused on the bonds created by that first chance encounter and the emotions that come out of it (<a href="https://colourful-jack.tumblr.com/post/718419854898741248/paper-talk-special-yoshihara-riekos-interview" target="_blank">1989 interview</a>). ai no kusabi is so focused on what it means to need someone that nothing else really matters. they were never meant to live happily ever after. they were meant to run into each other, crash, and burn in the heat of their own fiery yaoi passion.</p>

                <p>which is why i love the “microplastics esque yaoi” phrasing of that initial tweet so much. something about ai no kusabi burning hot and burning out vs microplastics esque yaoi of today built to last forever (happily ever afters, domestic dynamics, etc etc) while sacrificing the intensity of their desire. something something. i just know that i love my wildly absurd, all-consuming, 90s yaoi. the yaoi that feels like that one image of the alpha wolf ripping his shirt off. perhaps nothing was meant to last forever... do we really want to fight over microplastics esque yaoi that will outlive us?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="collumn">
                <p>so yes, ai no kusabi is ridiculous. it's tragic it's melodramatic it's problematic and it's hot. but it is also Raw. ai no kusabi showed me how yaoi can be both self-destructive and totally healing. ai no kusabi is yaoi that centers the meaning of desire, and what it costs. iason's feelings for riki caused him to abandon everything he ever was- to give in to his desires.. riki's feelings for iason caused him to lean on someone, fully, for the first time in his life. learning what it meant to be human. getting both ends of the yaoi love give-or-take spectrum is what makes ai no kusabi so special to me. </p>
                <span class="headline hl3">i so cherish these moments when you defy me. when you react to me so humanly.</span>
                <span class="headline hl4">- iason mink</span>
            <p>how am i meant to move on from this... how am i meant to move on with the rest of my life when iason mink himself said, <i>"i feel myself tingling right down to the center of my brain. i love how you look at me with such undisguised disdain. it's so endearing i want to rip out your beating heart and press it to my cheek."</i> is he crazy? is he crazy?? yes.</p>
