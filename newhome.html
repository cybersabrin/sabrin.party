    this is my own personal webpage! isn't that cool. i made this with my bare hands (with lots of help from online tutorials). i made this to create a home for myself where i can talk about all the things i like (and don't like) as an alternative to social media. social media is so bad for me (and for you too) and i want out! this is my alternative. it's healtier. and cooler. and customizable.

    at the moment i am trying out a new color scheme and Look for this site. my old color scheme made my own head hurt so... maybe it wasnt the best idea. i still think it's fun... just temporary. it looks boring now but i will make it more fun. i promise.

<p>
    once i am done redesigning this site, i'll probs just put the about me content right here on the home page... makes sense, right?
