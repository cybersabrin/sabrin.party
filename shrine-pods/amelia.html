    <h2 style="margin-left: 300px; margin-top: -280px;">the amelia project <span style="color: darkgray;">— Imploding Fictions</span></h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 300px; margin-top: -12px;">words cannot express how much i love this show, but i will try. the amelia project is a secret agency that fakes deaths in the most absurd ways and gives their clients a new identity to help them start over. the episodes start off as more isolated stories told through interviews with The Interviewer (who loves his cocoa... from Le Deux Magots, which is the only reason i would ever feel inclined to go to france), but it slowly merges into a more cohesive and Incredible narrative. we learn more about the Interviewer, our lovely surgeon Kozlowski, Amelia herself (who is played by julia morizawa aka dr. bright, by the way), and more of the cast as they experience life throughout the centuries, flee from international authorities, and do what they do best— share stories. one of my all-time favorite quotes about love is from this show, Kozlowski is a poet. expereince it for yourself. i could not reccomend this series enough.</p>
