    <h2 style="margin-left: 300px; margin-top: -280px;">welcome to night vale <span style="color: darkgray;">â€” Night Vale Presents</span></h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 300px; margin-top: -12px;">this right here is the campiest audio drama i've ever listened to, and it's Perfect. the first time i listened to this podcast, i was sick with a fever and none of it felt real. so i had to start the first couple episodes again once i got better to make sense of what i had just experienced. welcome to night vale is a (fictional) community radio show for a very Strange town... traffic updates that turn into tales of existential dread, weather segments that are just Songs from indie bands, and a strange six eyed winged cat named Khoshekh. i was really charmed by the stories this town had to offer. i will say the more cohesive narrative doesn't really kick in until about forty episodes in, which is a lot and i realize may be a turn off for many. but if you like listening to strange tales about a fascinating town while feeling like you're in a fever dream, you'll love this show..</p>
