        <p>every single scream movie</p>
        <img src="/images/library/scream.png" style="float: left; padding: 5px; height: 180px;">
        <p>i made plans to watch the new scream 6 movie with my friends this weekend, so in preparation i have taken it upon myself to watch every single scream movie before then, and i will compile my little Thoughts all into one post beause having 6 whole boxes on SCREAM feels insane. plus i don't think i'll have much to say on each individual one. we'll see though. watched the first one on 3/8 and loved it. too many breaking 4th wall jokes about Horror Movie Structure but it the scene where that nerd guy was like "behind you!" and the freaks in the van were watching him and screaming "behind you!" was really funny.</p>

        <img src="/images/library/thistlefoot.png" style="float: left; padding: 5px; height: 180px;">
        <p>i impulsively bought this book during my last trip to my local bookstore because i was very curious about this house with chicken legs... i'm about halfway through this book (as of march 3rd 2023) and my thoughts so far are: i <i>do</i> like the story, but the pacing right now is a little too slow for my taste. i don't want to drop it just yet but i also just want to hurry and finish it already! i hope things start to speed up soon. i am a little bit in love with isaac and want to know more about this benji fellow... <s>i am sensing queer themes here</s> (/▿＼ )</p>

        <p>the last of us</p>
        <img src="/images/library/tlou.png" style="float: left; padding: 5px; height: 180px;">
        <p>i am all caught up on the last of us, so now i am Pained with waiting for the weekly episodes to come out. this show is <i>really</i> well done, but i will say i'm a little disappointed that season 1 is so short? especially since all 7 episodes so far have been mostly exposition and set up? all beautifully done of course but to have a full season dedicated to exposition seems.. a bit strange. i still plan to watch season 2 when it comes out. i might play the games too.. if my heart can take it</p>

        <p>i used to be so normal about jjk since i first started watching the anime last year. but with the way this story has been developing i've gotten so obsessed with it? it's like a delayed reaction almost.. shibuya arc was absolutely devastating (<strong>#shibuyasurvivor</strong>), i read the whole thing in two days with my hand clutching my chest the whole time... can't think about it for too long or else i'll get nauseous. now i am caught up on the culling game arc where my biggest issue is getting attached to characters (higuruma.. kirara, hikari, <a href="https://twitter.com/hiraethiaa/status/1632442622445867012?s=20">kaori & jin</a>... my darlings) who either will never show up again or die a horrible brutal devastating tragic death... gege is a wicked man... worst of all is that my Favorite character in the entire series is kenjaku. who is sure to meet his demise sooner or later... pray 4 me and all the #kennyfansinternational<p>
          <p>march 9th update: please give megumi a break my god he's just a little lad...</p>

        <img src="/images/library/ae.png" style="float: left; padding: 5px; height: 180px;">
        <p>i don't ever seek out a comedy show because i just don't find them that funny but abbott elementary is the exceptional exception. this show is hilarious! every single episode has me a-kekekeing and heheheing (ﾉ≧∀≦)ﾉ my favorite duo is barbara and melissa, but the character who makes me laugh the most is definitely ava. i love that it's in a school setting too, since i am thinking about becoming a teacher maybe... mimimimi<p>

      <p>i love how adorable this show is. i did enjoy the first season a lot more than the second. especially towards the end with the yue Development and also just getting more growth out of sakura and li. i feel like the pacing was just more to my liking than it was in the second season. but!! i didn't <i>dislike</i> season 2 or anything, it's super cute and i am living for all the yukino and tomoya moments... (the best part of the entire series tbh) they mean so much to me (´｡• ω •｡`) ♡</p>
