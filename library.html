      <img src="/images/library/bl.png" style="float: left; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 8px; height: 180px;">
      <p>i had initially started reading this because i saw a lot of funny panels where the dialogue looked really silly, but i'm almost caught up now and i genuienly love this series. it's so very intense but the characters are all so loveable and crazy and i love all the portrayals of the different ways to love soccer. it's really fun. i'm probably misleading a few people by describing blue lock in such a wholesome way but it really is a sweet treat for me. my favorite players are shidou, rin, and isagi. and bachira too. but (more importantly) my favorite character dynamics are whatever rin and isagi & also shido and itoshi got going on. i just love it when it's the two characters that seem the most different that end up being the best matches for each other. it's also not that common i care so much about the main character but isagi i am rooting for you! you crazy little boy! いけ いけ いさぎ !<p>

        <p>i impulsively bought this book during my last trip to my local bookstore because i was very curious about this house with chicken legs... i'm about halfway through this book (as of march 3rd 2023) and my thoughts so far are: i <i>do</i> like the story, but the pacing right now is a little too slow for my taste. i don't want to drop it just yet but i also just want to hurry and finish it already! i hope things start to speed up soon. i am a little bit in love with isaac and want to know more about this benji fellow... <s>i am sensing queer themes here</s> (/▿＼ )</p>

        <p>i used to be so normal about jjk since i first started watching the anime last year. but with the way this story has been developing i've gotten so obsessed with it? it's like a delayed reaction almost.. shibuya arc was absolutely devastating (<strong>#shibuyasurvivor</strong>), i read the whole thing in two days with my hand clutching my chest the whole time... can't think about it for too long or else i'll get nauseous. now i am caught up on the culling game arc where my biggest issue is getting attached to characters (higuruma.. kirara, hikari, <a href="https://twitter.com/hiraethiaa/status/1632442622445867012?s=20">kaori & jin</a>, and now yorozu... my darlings) who either will never show up again or die a horrible brutal devastating tragic death... gege is a wicked man... worst of all is that my Favorite character in the entire series is kenjaku. who is sure to meet his demise sooner or later... pray 4 me and all the #kennyfansinternational... i wish gege would let my babies be happy..... meguyujibara NEED a happy ending or else i will cease to be a human being...<p>

        <p>i don't ever seek out a comedy show because i just don't find them that funny but abbott elementary is the exceptional exception. this show is hilarious! every single episode has me a-kekekeing and heheheing (ﾉ≧∀≦)ﾉ my favorite duo is barbara and melissa, but the character who makes me laugh the most is definitely ava. i love that it's in a school setting too, since i am thinking about becoming a teacher maybe... mimimimi<p>

      <p>i watched the first two episodes of this show last night and finished the first season this morning (a good binge, if i do say so myself). this series was beautifully done. the two biggest things that stood out to me in this show was the visuals and the incredible acting (i usually do not notice good/bad acting but it really stood out in this show and i loved it so much). i didn't want to give this show a rating because it's so heavily based on real events, and i don't give ratings on biographies or anything like that. i absolutely loved it though, it was thrilling and  beautifully made. i won't write about spoiler events now because it's so new but i highly recommend!</p>

      <p>the last of us (season 1)</p>
      <img src="/images/library/tlou.png" style="float: left; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 8px; height: 180px;">
      <p>after watching the entire first season what i have to say is: man this show is just so beautifully written. and amazingly produced. i think the scene in the season finale where joel is killing everyone in the hospital but the audio is muffled almost like you're putting your hands over your ears was so powerful to me. chefs kiss absolutely brillaint. that will stick with me forever. the worldbuilding is just so cool. i've been seeing side by side comparisons of the show and the game and i am so impressed by how true to the source material they are. i haven't played the games but i know many who have and they all have told me that even though they know what will happen they are still hooked and excited to see what each episode brings. i love joel ellie so much. best duo to ever duo.</p>

      <p>every single scream movie</p>
      <img src="/images/library/scream.png" style="float: left; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 8px; height: 180px;">
      <p>i have taken it upon myself to watch every single scream movie in a row, and i will compile my little Thoughts all into one post because having 6 boxes on SCREAM feels insane. plus i don't think i'll have much to say on each individual one. we'll see though.</p>
      <p><strong>(3/8/23) scream 1:</strong> loved it. too many breaking 4th wall jokes about Horror Movie Structure <i>but</i> the scene where that nerd guy was like "behind you!" and the freaks in the van were watching him and screaming "behind you!" was really funny.</p>
      <p><strong>(3/10/23) scream 2:</strong> i see that the fourth wall thing is a Bit now. i get it. it's fun i do enjoy it now a lot more. i started to get bored halfway though because i just don't care about dewey and Monica (who i know is not actually  named monica). but then the end got exciting again. even though i wasn't a fan of the killers this time. felt like something was missing...</p>
      <p><strong>scream 3:</strong> what is sid's kill count at this point my god! they can't let her keep getting away with this!!!!</p>
      <p><strong>(3/11/23) scream 4:</strong> alright we're starting to pick up. better than 3, pretty good. i did get a little bored halfway through tho. again. i loved emma roberts though. i think i would have disliked this one a lot more without her performance. she carried!!!</p>
      <p><strong>scream 5:</strong> i think this one might be my favorite so far. i suddenly care more about dewey and monica now. i've started to love the movie structure monologues they do every time it makes me feel like i'm taking film 101. amber has been my favorite killer so far besides the originals i'd say. the fact that it's all in the same house is a detail i loved. ugh! everything was done so much better.</p>
      <p><strong>scream 6:</strong> an incredible movie!!! i'm so glad i got to see this one in theaters. i absolutely love the killers in this one, the acting was incredible and tbh i supported them! i'll be vague to avoid spoilers since this one is so new, but ahh!!! the twist?! so good. i totally didn't see you-know-who coming back. and then the thing!!! and then he made it!!!!! wow. haha. 5/5. my official ranking as of my Feelings right now are 1, 4+5 all tied for first. then its 4, 2, and then 3. what a great franchise. <s>scream7 now!!!!!!!!!!</s></p>

      <p>i love how adorable this show is. i did enjoy the first season a lot more than the second. especially towards the end with the yue Development and also just getting more growth out of sakura and li. i feel like the pacing was just more to my liking than it was in the second season. but!! i didn't <i>dislike</i> season 2 or anything, it's super cute and i am living for all the yukino and tomoya moments... (the best part of the entire series tbh) they mean so much to me (´｡• ω •｡`) ♡</p>
